Leave granted.BRIEF BACKGROUND: 2. In the present batch of cases, the constitutionality of Part XIV of the FinanceAct, 2017 and of the rules framed in consonance has been assailed.  While it would be repetitious to reproduce the pleadings of each case separately, a brief reference is  being  made,  illustratively,  to  the  prayers  made  in three matters  to  aid the formulation of core issues arising for adjudication. 3. The Madras Bar Association has preferred Writ Petition (Civil) No. 267 of2012 seeking the following reliefs: 1“i. A writ of mandamus, directing the Union of India, to implement the directions of this Hon’ble Court in Union of India v. R. Gandhi [(2010) 11 SCC 1, para 96 at pg. 310] and L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India [(1997) 3 SCC 261], paras 120 and 121 at page 65 to 67], where Ministry of Law and Justice, Govt. Of India was ordered to take over the administration of all tribunals created by Parliament and streamline the functioning of the same.  ii. A writ of mandamus directing the Ministry of Law & Justice to promptly carry out a ‘Judicial Impact Assessment’ on all tribunals created by Parliament and submit a report on the same to this Hon’ble Court.”  4.  This  Writ  Petition  was  originally  heard  by  a  three-judge  Bench  on  18th February,  2015  wherein  it  was  observed  that  the  case  presented  substantial questions of Constitutional interpretation, necessitating hearing by a Constitution Bench. The orders passed from time to time reveal that, on 18th January, 2016, this Court  perused  the  contents  of  the  Tribunals,  Appellate  Tribunals  and  other Authorities  (Conditions  of  Service)  Bill,  2014  and  felt  that “it  would  be  more appropriate if observations made in Union of India vs. R. Gandhi, President, Madras  Bar  Association1  (in  paragraphs  64-70)  are  also  considered  by  the Government.”  5.  The  matter  was  listed  again  on  27th  March,  2019  and  this  Court  took cognizance of non-implementation of the directions issued vide para 96 of L. Chandra Kumar vs. Union of India2, which reads as follows: “96.   We  are  of the opinion  that, until a  wholly independent  agency for the administration of all such Tribunals can be set up, it is desirable that all such tribunals should be, as far as possible, under a single nodal ministry which will be in a position to oversee the working of these tribunals.  For a number of reasons that Ministry should appropriately be the Ministry of Law.  It would be open for the Ministry, in its turn, to appoint an independent supervisory body to oversee the working of the Tribunals.”  1 (2010) 11 SCC 1. 2 (1997) 3 SCC 261. 26.  Thereafter on the same day, this Court opined as follows:  “Tentatively, we are of the view that the said directions ought to have been implemented by the Government of India long back.  In the course of hearing today, learned Attorney General for India relying on an affidavit filed on behalf of the Union of India in the year 2013, had pointed out certain difficulties including the need for an amendment of the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961.  Learned Attorney General has also pointed out that the Ministry of Law and Justice is overburdened and may not be able to act and function as the nodal agency, which the Court had in mind while issuing directions way back in the year 1997 in L. Chandra Kumar (supra).  There cannot by any manner of doubt that to ensure the efficient functioning and to streamline the working of Tribunals, they should be brought under one agency, as already felt and observed by this Court in L. Chandra Kumar (supra).  The Court would like to have benefit of the view of the Government of India as on today by means of an affidavit of the competent authority to be filed within two weeks from today. The second prayer made in the writ petition has also been considered by us and in this regard we have taken note of compilation placed before the Court by the learned Attorney General, which would go to show the present vacancy position in different Tribunals, which is one of the issues that we would attempt to resolve.  From the compilation  of  the  learned  Attorney  General,  it  appears  that  the  Central Administrative Tribunal, the Intellectual Property Appellate Board, the Armed Forces Tribunal, the National Green Tribunal and the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal would require immediate attention.  While every endeavour would be made by the nominee of the Chief Justice who heads the Selection Committee before whom the issue of recommendations may have been pending to expedite the same, such of the recommendations which have already been made by the Search-cum-Selection Committee as is in the case of National Company Law Tribunal and National Law Appellate Tribunal, should be immediately implemented by making appointments within the aforesaid period of two weeks and the result thereof be placed before the Court vide affidavit of the competent authority, as ordered to be filed by the present order. Once the aforesaid information is made available, appropriate orders will be passed by this Court, which may, inter alia, include remitting the matter to smaller Bench for monitoring on a continuous basis, so as to ensure due and proper functioning of the Tribunals.  Matter be listed before this Bench after two weeks.” 7.  During the pendency of the aforementioned writ petition, the present lead matter bearing SLP(C) No. 15804/2017 was filed by Rojer Mathew, assailing the final judgment and order of the High Court of Kerala. The petitioner had originally approached the High Court challenging the constitutional validity of Section 13 (5-A) of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest (SARFAESI) Act, 2002 which permits secured creditors to participate in auction of immoveable property if it remained unsold for want of 3reserve bid in an earlier auction. Rojer Mathew claimed that the aforementioned provision violated his rights under Article 300A and Article 14 of the Constitution, besides being in contravention of the Code of Civil Procedure which prohibits mortgagees from participating in auction of immovable property without prior Court permission. 8.  During the course of arguments, it was brought to the notice of this Court that appointments to the Debt Recovery Tribunals was not in consonance with the Constitutional spirit of judicial independence. Accordingly, though Rojer Mathew was given an opportunity to approach the High Court for reconsideration of his plea on 16th May, 2018, nevertheless this Court kept his petition pending to allow consideration of broader issues concerning restructuring of Tribunals. Assistance of Shri Arvind P. Datar, Sr. Advocate as Amicus Curiae was also requested by this Court. 9.  The third matter to be taken note of is Writ Petition (Civil) No. 279/2017 where  the  petitioner,  Kudrat  Sandhu,  has  filed  a  Public  Interest  Litigation challenging the vires of Part XIV of the Finance Act, 2017 by which the provisions of twenty-five different enactments were amended to effect sweeping changes to the requisite qualifications, method of appointment, terms of office, salaries and allowances, and various other terms and conditions of service of the members and presiding officers of different statutory Tribunals. The impugned provisions of the Finance Act, 2017 have been referred to in extenso at appropriate parts of this order.  4 GENESIS OF TRIBUNALISATION: 10.  Delay and backlogs in the administration of justice is of paramount concern for any country governed by the rule of law. In our present judicial setup, disputes often take many decades to attain finality, travelling across a series of lower courts to the High Court and ending with an inevitable approach to the Supreme Court.  11.  Such crawling pace of the justice delivery system only aggravates the misery of affected parties. Although with nebulous origins, the adage “justice delayed, is justice denied” is apt in this context. Courts in this country, probably in a quest to ensure complete justice for everyone, overlook the importance of expediency and finality. This situation has only worsened over the years, as evidenced through piling pendency across all Courts. It would however be wrong to place the blame of such delay squarely on the judiciary, for an empirical examination of pendency clearly demonstrates that the ratio of judges against the country’s population is one of the lowest in the world and the manpower (support staff) and infrastructure provided is dismal. 12.  In addition to the delay in administration of justice, another important facet requiring attention is the rise of specialization and increase of complex regulatory and commercial aspects, which require esoteric appraisal and adjudication.  The existing lower courts in the country are not well equipped to deal with such complex new issues which see constant evolution as compared to the stable nature of existing civil, criminal and the tax jurisprudence.  513.  Evidently, there is a desperate need to overcome these hurdles of delay in administration of justice. Creation of tribunals has evolved as one solution in the ever-constant strive to increase access to justice. A ‘Tribunal’ can be understood as  a  body  tasked  with  discharging  quasi-judicial  functions  with  the  primary objective of providing a special forum for specific type of disputes and for faster and more efficacious adjudication of issues. In Jaswant Sugar Mills Ltd., Meerut vs. Lakshmichand3, a test was laid down whereunder it is to be examined whether the authority has the trappings of a Court, facets of which include the authority to make determinations, evidentiary and procedural powers and ability to impose sanctions. However, per a five-judge bench in Associated Cement Co. Ltd. v. PN Sharma4,  Tribunals  were  vested  with  a  primarily  judicial  character  for  it  was observed that: \"9. ….. Special matters and questions are entrusted to them for their decision and in that sense, they share with the courts one common characteristic; both the courts and the tribunals are “constituted by the State and are invested with judicial as distinguished  from  purely  administrative  or  executive  functions”,  (vide Durga Shankar Mehta v. Thakur Raghuraj Singh [(1955) 1 SCR 267 at p. 272] ). They are both adjudicating bodies and they deal with and finally determine disputes between parties which are entrusted to their jurisdiction. The procedure followed by the courts is regularly prescribed  and in discharging  their functions and exercising  their powers, the courts have to conform to that procedure. The procedure which the tribunals have to follow may not always be so strictly prescribed, but the approach adopted by both the courts and the tribunals is substantially the same, and there is no essential difference between the functions that they discharge. As in the case of courts, so in the case of tribunals, it is the State\\'s inherent judicial power which has been transferred and by virtue of the said power, it is the State\\'s inherent judicial function which they discharge. Judicial functions and judicial powers are one of the essential attributes of a sovereign State, and on considerations of policy, the State transfers its judicial functions and powers mainly to the courts established by the Constitution; but that does not affect the competence of the State, by appropriate measures, to transfer a part of its judicial powers and functions to tribunals by entrusting to them the task of adjudicating upon special matters and disputes  3 AIR 1963 SC 677. 4 AIR 1965 SC 1595. 6between parties. It is really not possible or even expedient to attempt to describe exhaustively the features which are common to the tribunals and the courts, and features which are distinct and separate. The basic and the fundamental feature which is common to both the courts and the tribunals is that they discharge judicial functions and exercise judicial powers which inherently vest in a sovereign State.” 14.  Further, this Court has in various judgments explicitly held that tribunals are mutually  exclusive  from  administrative  or  legislative  bodies,  and  although  not strictly Courts, they nevertheless perform judicial functions. With the inclusion of technical members along with judicial members in composition of Tribunals, it is ensured that the adjudicatory authority is equipped with the technical knowledge required to comprehend and decide issues involving specialised subjects. 15.  Such issues are not unique to our country. Globally, the issues such as need for  specialization  or  pendency  have  resulted  in  a  unanimous  consensus  for tribunalisation. A perusal of the prevailing legal regime governing tribunals and their interface with the government, provides a useful benchmark in examining methods to retain their character. AN INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE  16.  The global approach to the institution of specialized Tribunals is a largely consistent one.   A cursory examination brings to fore a universal inherent need to disperse disputes across different adjudicatory bodies to reduce the burden on Constitutional Courts and ensure faster resolution of specific disputes. Almost all countries in the world have incorporated laws pertaining to the working of Tribunals within their Constitutional framework in some form or the other. In light of our common law traditions and colonial history, it would be imperative to examine the position of law across the world:  7I.  United Kingdom 17.  Tribunals are one of the most important institutions in the dispensation of justice in the British Judicial system. Numerous Tribunals have been established to deal with issues involving property rights, employment, immigration, mental health, etc. Their functions are similar to the mainstream judicial bodies and are concerned with disputes between individuals and the State. However, there is a stark distinction between Tribunals and Ordinary Courts in England; for unlike ordinary Courts, the Tribunals comprise of members with special expertise and experience with many of them being appointed from amongst advocates or from persons with technical exposure.  18.  Such tribunalisation traces its origins to the early twentieth century. The efficacy of a specialised, quasi-judicial body for adjudication of specific disputes was realised over a period of time as the newly evolved system of Tribunals gradually gained appreciation and recognition in the legal fraternity. During the development of the railways in the early 19th century, the judges found themselves ill-equipped  to  deal  with  technically  specialised  trade  disputes  arising  from monopolistic  railway  companies.  Such  inexpert  adjudication  also  resulted  in dissatisfaction  of  the  litigants.  Consequently,  a  specialized  tribunal  of Commissioners was appointed in 1873 and later converted to the Railways and Canals Commission. Later in the nineteenth century, the British Government set up tribunals for pension and unemployment benefit to enhance accessibility to the poor  and  less-educated,  including,  special  tribunals  set  up  to  adjudicate disablement pensions for servicemen wounded in World War I. In the twentieth century, post the Leggatt review, many dozens of tribunals for subjects as diverse 8as tax, mental health, social security, employment and asylum were set up, with thousands of adjudicating members.  19.  As Tribunals started marking their individual identity and resolving conflicts brought before them, there was an emergent need to amend the framework of these alternate fora in tune with societal changes. The Donoughmore Committee, in 1932, critiqued the delegation of judicial functions to quasi-judicial body and recommended that the judicial powers should vest solely with the Ordinary Courts of law. It was further recommended that establishment of Tribunals should only be in special cases where Ordinary Courts lacks expertise.  Applicability of principles of natural justice must also be extended to such Tribunals. Courts should be adequately empowered to ensure that the Tribunals function within their restricted domain.  20.  The need for supervisory jurisdiction over Tribunals was again discussed in 1957  when  the  Frank’s  Committee  made  its  recommendations  which  were implemented by the Tribunal and Inquiries Act, 1958. The Frank’s Committee Report presented a glowing critique in favour of tribunalisation, contending that it was cheaper, faster, better and more accessible. This finding has been echoed by various international commissions which have noted the beneficial impacts of tribunalisation  viz.,  cost  effectiveness,  accessibility,  reduction  in  pendency, specialized expertise, etc.  “Tribunals are not ordinary courts, but neither are they appendages of Government Departments. Much of the official evidence … appeared to reflect the view that tribunals should properly be regarded as part of the machinery of administration, for which the Government must retain a close and continuing responsibility. Thus, for example, tribunals in the social services field would be regarded as adjuncts to the administration of the services themselves. We do not accept this view. We consider that tribunals should properly be regarded as machinery provided by Parliament for 9adjudication rather than as part of the machinery of administration. The essential point is that in all these cases Parliament has deliberately provided for a decision outside and independent of the Department concerned, either at first instance … or on appeal from a decision of a Minister or of an official in a special statutory position… Although the relevant statutes do not in all cases expressly enact that tribunals are to consist entirely of persons outside the Government service, the use of the term ‘tribunal’ in legislation undoubtedly bears this connotation, and the intention of Parliament to provide for the independence of tribunals is clear and unmistakable.”5 21.  Pursuant to this, the Council on Tribunals was established with the purpose of  overseeing  composition  and  working  of  various  Tribunals.  Further,  the  Sir Andrew  Leggatt  Committee  (2001)  scrutinised  the  existing  state  of  Tribunals wherein  the  inherent  deficiencies  of  a  non-uniform  Tribunal  system  were highlighted. The report of the Committee, titled ‘Tribunals for User— One System, One Service’ suggested a new structurally reformed system of Tribunals with a more uniform administration and procedure. It was also suggested that a single Appellate Division should be the only route of appeal against the orders of the Tribunals. In 2007, the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act was enacted which formulated a new system of two Tribunals -the First-tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal - with unified route for appeal.6  22.  In the year 2006 the United Kingdom created a Tribunal Service, which was later merged with the Courts Service in 2010, resulting in the creation of a single cohesive judicial structure and service for the country.   5 Drewry, Gavin, “The Judicialisation of Administrative Tribunals in the U.K: From Hewart to Leggatt” 28 TRAS 51 (2009) 6 Excerpts from the ‘Explanatory Notes to the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act, 2007’ prepared by the Ministry of Justice, British Parliament. 10 II. Canada 23.  The Tribunal system in Canada, although of recent origin, is well established having a distinct identity of its own. Similar to the system in England, in Canada too, the Tribunal system has successfully become one of the foundations of the judicial system.7 Federal or provincial legislations are enacted to constitute and empower specialised Tribunals for specific subject matters such as human rights, insurance claims, etc.8 The work of the Tribunals are regulated by legislation and Members are usually appointed for their expertise in the subject.  24.  Many of the Tribunals are empowered by their enabling legislation or general legislations to have powers similar to Civil Courts. However, Tribunals in Canada are  less  formal  than  Courts  and  are  outside  the  general  Court  system;  their decisions are subject to Judicial Review to ensure adherence to law. In a striking resemblance  to  our  judicial  system,  the  Canadian  Constitution  also  provides inherent power of judicial review of decisions of Tribunals to superior Courts, where either no provision of appeal is provided or is specifically barred by a statute. Appeals from orders of Tribunals in Canada are heard by Federal Court of Canada, the immediate forum below the Supreme Court of Canada.    7  Malik,  Lokendra;  Lata,  Kusum;  Kaur,  Avneet,  Constitutional  Government  in  India  (Satyam  Law International, New Delhi, 2016) at p. 191. 8   Administrative  Tribunals  in  Canada,  available  at: http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/administrative-tribunals/ (last visited on 10.09.2019). 11 III.  Australia 25.  The  Australian  system  of  Tribunals  is  an  amalgamation  of  the  system prevalent in England and Canada. Tribunals in Australia were established primarily to reduce the burden on Civil Courts and provide an effective, yet cheap means of justice for the public. There prevails a variety of Tribunals to review different types of Government decisions including social security, taxation, etc. The Tribunals serve a multifarious purpose, deciding issues between individuals and individuals & State. For instance, in several Australian States, the Tribunals work as Small Claims Courts. The Court of Appeals is a facet of the Supreme Court, enjoying appellate powers over all the other Courts and Tribunals in the country.  IV.   United States of America 26.  The doctrine of separation of powers is adhered to in a much stringent manner in comparison to other common law countries. There is no delegation of judicial powers and no judicial power is vested in administrative bodies which are not Courts. The inception of judicial control over administrative action was with the enactment of Administrative Procedure Act, 1946. However, the Act merely made the  decisions  of  Tribunals  appealable  on  question  of  interpretation  of  law. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court of the United States had taken a more liberal view of the same leaving scope, though extremely limited, for judicial review.    12V. France 27.  Being a Civil Law system, France has a dual legal system comprising of— Private Law (droit privé) and Administrative Law (droit administratif).9 It has a special  Tribunal  viz.  Tribunal  des  Conflicts  for  performing  both  judicial  and administrative functions.10 The decisions of Tribunal des Conflicts are not entirely within the purview of judicial review. Judicial Review is expressly ousted from some of the administrative actions. Further, to adjudicate disputes between individual and officials of State, the Counseil d’Etat was formed.  28.  With change in time, the Tribunal system of France also evolved. A new Three-Tier  Tribunal  system  was  established.  The  first  tier  being  Tribunal administratif — Administrative Court or the Original Court having a wide jurisdiction covering all subject matters; the second tier is Cour administrative d\\'appel — Administrative Court of Appeal, formed to decide appeals from the Original Court and; the third tier is Conseil d\\'Etat — Court of Last Resort, which was formed to finally decide appeals from the Original Court or Court of Appeal. However, unlike in common law countries, the Appellate Courts in France lack power of judicial review on the ground of authority being ultra vires.  VI.  South Africa  29.  South Africa having similar colonial origins as India, inherited a similar legal system as India. Having multiple functions and discharging a range of judicial,  9 George A. Bermann; Etienne Picard, Introduction to French Law (Kluwer Law International, Netherlands, 2008) at p. 58. 10 Bartlett, C. A. Hereshoff, “The French Judicial System” 33 CLT 952 (1913). 13quasi-judicial as well as administrative powers, every tribunal is a unique creation of its parent statute. Akin to many critiques in India, such tribunals are often criticized for their lack of uniformity, incoherence and haphazardness. DOMESTIC PERCEPTION: 30.  It is interesting to note that establishment of Tribunals in India relate back to as early as the year 1941 when the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) was established  to  expedite  tax  disputes.  To  structuralise  the  establishment  of Tribunals, vide the 42nd Constitutional Amendment, Article 323A and 323B were introduced,  delineating  powers  as  well  as  the  composition  and  formation  of Tribunals. Numerous Tribunals thereafter have been established, with the source of power to legislate for establishing such tribunals being referable to Article 323A or Article 323B of the Constitution. The three-tier tribunal system in India finds its resemblance to the system as prevalent in France. The forums of first instance have Original Jurisdiction with High Court as the Appellate Court and the Supreme Court being the final adjudicatory body. Furthermore, it is not out of context to point out the similarity of the Constitution of India with the Canadian Constitution, insofar as it also provides inherent power of judicial review to Constitutional Courts over all subordinate Courts.  31.  Hence,  the  need  for  establishment  of  newer  and  more  specialised adjudicatory bodies is not newfound but has evolved through developments spread over an era.    14I.  Administrative Reforms Commission - 1966  32.  The Administrative Reforms Commission was set up to explore the arenas for  establishing  Administrative  Tribunals  for  different  subject  matters.  It recommended establishment of Civil Services Tribunals as adjudicatory entities for disciplinary punishments awarded to civil servants.  II. Wanchoo Committee - 1970 33.  The  Wanchoo  Committee  recommended  reforms  to  the  Income  Tax Appellate  Tribunal  to  effectuate  replacement  of  Civil  Courts  for  expeditious redressal  of  tax  disputes.  It  also  recommended  formation  of  a  Direct  Taxes Settlement Tribunal to ensure speedy remedies and decisions of disputes.  III.  High Court’s Arrears Committee Report - 1972 34.  A committee headed by Justice JC Shah highlighted an urgent need for individual-specialised Tribunals for exclusively dealing with service matters and to unburden High Courts by restricting the barrage of writ petitions being filed by government employees.  IV.  Swaran Singh Committee - 1976 35.  The  Swaran  Singh  Committee  took  a  radical  view  by  advocating amendments to the Constitution for regulation of Tribunals and to curtail the writ jurisdiction of High Court and the Supreme Court. This report attracted a lot of critique from the legal fraternity and was later rejected in Sakinala Hari Nath vs. State Of Andhra Pradesh11.  11 1993 (3) ALT 471; See also: L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India 1997 (2) SCR 1186 15V. Raghavan Committee - 2002 36.  In accordance with contemporaneous evolutions in the commercial sphere, the  Raghavan  Committee  was  set  up  to  suggest  methods  to  regulate  anti-competitive  practices.  This  Committee  recommended  establishment  of  the Competition  Commission  of  India  (CCI),  which  was  envisioned  to  maintain adequate competition in the market and protect consumer welfare. Further, the Competition Act, 2002 was later enacted which provided certain powers of Civil Courts to the CCI for effective enquiry and adjudication. 37.  Tribunals  can  thus  be  viewed  as  alternate  avenues  to  facilitate  swift dispensation  of  justice  through  less-formal  procedures  of  adjudication.  An examination of existing Tribunals in India and across foreign jurisdictions, shows that they are best suited to deal with complex subject-matters requiring technical expertise such as service law, tax law, company law or environment law, etc. LEGISLATIVE DEVELOPMENT OF TRIBUNALISATION : 38.  In  India,  the  Constitution  (42nd  Amendment)  Act,  1976  paved  way  for tribunalisation of the justice dispensation system by introduction of Articles 323A and 323B in the Constitution.  These provisions are to the following effect: “PART XIV-A: TRIBUNALS 323-A. Administrative tribunals.—(1) Parliament may, by law, provide for the adjudication or trial by administrative tribunals of disputes and complaints with respect to recruitment and conditions of service of persons appointed to public services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or of any State or of any local or other authority within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India or of any corporation owned or controlled by the Government. (2) A law made under clause (1) may— (a) provide for the establishment of an administrative tribunal for the Union and a separate administrative tribunal for each State or for two or more States; 16(b) specify the jurisdiction, powers (including the power to punish for contempt) and authority which may be exercised by each of the said tribunals; (c) provide for the procedure (including provisions as to limitation and rules of evidence) to be followed by the said tribunals; (d) exclude the jurisdiction of all courts, except the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 136, with respect to the disputes or complaints referred to in clause (1); (e) provide for the transfer to each such administrative tribunal of any cases pending before any court or other authority immediately before the establishment of such tribunal as would have been within the jurisdiction of such tribunal if the causes of action  on  which  such  suits  or  proceedings  are  based  had  arisen  after  such establishment; (f) repeal or amend any order made by the President under clause (3) of Article 371-D; (g) contain such supplemental, incidental and consequential provisions (including provisions  as  to  fees)  as  Parliament  may  deem  necessary  for  the  effective functioning of, and for the speedy disposal of cases by, and the enforcement of the orders of, such tribunals. (3) The provisions of this article shall have effect notwithstanding anything in any other provision of this Constitution or in any other law for the time being in force. 323-B. Tribunals for other matters.—(1) The appropriate Legislature may, by law, provide for the adjudication or trial by tribunals of any disputes, complaints, or offences with respect to all or any of the matters specified in clause (2) with respect to which such Legislature has power to make laws. (2) The matters referred to in clause (1) are the following, namely:— (a) levy, assessment, collection and enforcement of any tax; (b) foreign exchange, import and export across customs frontiers; (c) industrial and labour disputes; (d) land reforms by way of acquisition by the State of any estate as defined in Article 31-A or of any rights therein or the extinguishment or modification of any such rights or by way of ceiling on agricultural land or in any other way; (e) ceiling on urban property; (f) elections to either House of Parliament or the House or either House of the Legislature of a State, but excluding the matters referred to in Article 329 and Article 329-A; (g) production, procurement, supply and distribution of foodstuffs (including edible oilseeds and oils) and such other goods as the President may, by public notification, declare to be essential goods for the purpose of this article and control of prices of such goods; (h)  rent, its regulation and control and tenancy issues including the right, title and interest of landlords and tenants; (i) offences against laws with respect to any of the matters specified in sub-clauses (a) to (h) and fees in respect of any of those matters; (j)  any matter incidental to any of the matters specified in sub-clauses (a) to (i).  17(3) A law made under clause (1) may— (a) provide for the establishment of a hierarchy of tribunals; (b) specify the jurisdiction, powers (including the power to punish for contempt) and authority which may be exercised by each of the said tribunals; (c) provide for the procedure (including provisions as to limitation and rules of evidence) to be followed by the said tribunals; (d) exclude the jurisdiction of all courts except the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 136 with respect to all or any of the matters falling within the jurisdiction of the said tribunals; (e) provide for the transfer to each such tribunal of any cases pending before any court or any other authority immediately before the establishment of such tribunal as would have been within the jurisdiction of such tribunal if the causes of action on which such suits or proceedings are based had arisen after such establishment; (f) contain such supplemental, incidental and consequential provisions (including provisions as to fees) as the appropriate Legislature may deem necessary for the effective  functioning  of,  and  for  the  speedy  disposal  of  cases  by,  and  the enforcement of the orders of, such tribunals. (4) The provisions of this article shall have effect notwithstanding anything in any other provision of this Constitution or in any other law for the time being in force. Explanation.—In this article, “appropriate Legislature”, in relation to any matter, means Parliament or, as the case may be, a State Legislature competent to make laws with respect to such matter in accordance with the provisions of Part XI.” 39.  Drawing  its  competence  from  Article  323A  of  the  Constitution,  the Parliament enacted the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985.  The primary objective was to provide a forum alternative to the High Courts for routine service appeals, which otherwise was overburdening the working of the Constitutional Courts. It recognised that the higher Courts were envisaged to primarily deal with important Constitutional issues and substantial question of law of general public importance.  40.  Furthermore, guidelines were issued by this Court in numerous decisions to highlight a paucity of technical expertise in certain subject-matters and thus the imminent need for an expedited disposal of such cases through Tribunals. It was 18indicated in M.C. Mehta v. Union of India12, that a dedicated Tribunal with both judicial and technical experts is necessary to hear environmental disputes. 41.  Consequently, the National Environment Tribunal Act, 1995 and National Environment Appellate Authority Act, 1997 were enacted. However, these were soon found to be incapable of providing expeditious resolution of disputes which necessitated reforms as suggested by the Law Commission of India. This led to the establishment of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in 2010 as a special fast-track Court only to deal with issues related to the environment.  42.  Similarly,  Article  323B  empowers  the  appropriate  Legislature  to  enact legislation  to  provide  for  adjudication  or  trial  by  Tribunals  of  any  disputes, complaints or offences with respect to the matters specified in Clause (2) of the said Article. The matters specified in Article 323B(2) exhaustively deal with a variety of matters which can be brought within the purview of tribunalisation by both the Parliament and State Legislatures. JUDICIAL DEVELOPMENT OF TRIBUNALISATION : 43.  This  Court  has  observed  through  numerous  decisions  that  the  term ‘Tribunal’  refers  to  a  quasi-judicial  authority.  A  test  to  determine  whether  a particular body was merely an administrative organ of the Executive or a Tribunal was  evolved  by  this  Court  in  Jaswant  Sugar  Mills  Ltd.,  Meerut  vs. Lakshmichand13. It was to be examined whether the body is vested with powers of a Civil Court or not, and it was held that any adjudicatory body vested with  12 1986 (2) SCC 176 13 AIR 1963 SC 677. 19powers of taking evidence, summoning of witnesses, etc. must be categorised as a Tribunal. 44.  In  R.K.  Jain  vs.  Union  of  India14  a  three-judge  Bench  of  this  Court emphasised  the  need  for  a  safe  and  sound  justice  delivery  system  adept  at satisfying the confidence of litigants. It was further noted that since members of Tribunals discharge quasi-judicial functions, it is imperative that they possess requisite legal expertise, some judicial experience and an iota of legal training. Moreover, since Tribunals are constituted as substitutes to Courts, their efficacy in upholding the faith of litigants cannot be compromised. It was however observed that true delivery of justice by Tribunals was still a far-fetched idea since the mechanism for judicial review and remedy of appeal to the Supreme Court was costly and discouraging. People from remote areas often found their right to appeal being  handicapped  by  geographical  and  financial  constraints.  Hence,  it  was suggested by this Court that newer fora be dispersed across the country and that members from the Bar also be included in the composition of such Tribunals. An urgent need to reform the working of tribunals and regular monitoring of their functioning was also stressed upon.  45.  Subsequently, in L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India15, a Constitution Bench of seven judges of this Court examined reports of expert committees and commissions analysing the problem of arrears. The Malimath Committee Report (1989-1990) was also referred to, wherein it was found that many Tribunals failed the test of public confidence due to purported lack of competence, objectivity and  14 (1993) 4 SCC 119. 15  (1997) 3 SCC 261. 20judicial  approach.  This  Court  thus  called  for  drastic  measures  to  elevate  the standards of Tribunals in the country.  46.  It was also reiterated that the exclusion of judicial review by High Courts was impermissible  and  providing  direct  statutory  appeals  to  the  Supreme  Court impeded the common litigant from exercising his right to appeal because the appellate forum, being situated in Delhi, was inaccessible to many. While criticising the short terms of members and the lack of judicial experience of non-judicial members, this Court observed a need for establishment of an oversight mechanism to review the competence of all persons manning Tribunals. Thus, it was suggested that all Tribunals be brought under a ‘Single Nodal Ministry’, most appropriately the Ministry of Law & Justice, for overseeing of working of Tribunals. Liberty was however, granted to the Ministry to appoint an independent supervisory body to delegate the aforesaid functions. Further, the court noted that the procedure of selection of members of Tribunals, allocation of funds and all other intricacies would have to be culled out by such an umbrella organisation.  47.  In Union of India vs. R. Gandhi, President, Madras Bar Association16, a Constitution Bench of five judges of this Court reviewed the Constitutional validity of Parts I-B and I-C of The Companies Act, 1956 inserted by the Companies (2nd Amendment) Act, 2002.  48.  The  bench  observed  that  if  Tribunals  are  established  in  substitution  of Courts, they must also possess independence, security and capacity. Additionally, with transfer of jurisdiction from a traditional Court to a Tribunal, it would be  16 (2010) 11 SCC 1 21imperative to include members of the judiciary as presiding officers/members of the Tribunal. Technical members could only be in addition to judicial members and that also only when specialised knowledge or know-how is required. Any inclusion of  technical  members  in  the  absence  of  any  discernible  requirement  of specialisation would amount to dilution and encroachment upon the independence of the judiciary.  49.  This Court also observed that higher administrative experience does not necessarily  result  in  better  adjudication  and  that  there  had  been  a  gradual encroachment on the independence of the judiciary through inclusion of more administrative/technical  members  in  the  Tribunals.  It  held  that  such  practice needed to be checked and accordingly made requisite corrections to Parts I-B and I-C of The Companies Act, 1956 (as amended in 2002) as elucidated in para 120 of the judgement, which is reproduced below: “120. We may tabulate the corrections required to set right the defects in Parts I-B and I-C of the Act: (i) Only Judges and advocates can be considered for appointment as judicial members of the Tribunal. Only High Court Judges, or Judges who have served in the rank of a District Judge for at least five years or a person who has practised as a lawyer for ten years can be considered for appointment as a judicial member. Persons who have held a Group A or equivalent post under the Central or State Government with experience in the Indian Company Law Service (Legal Branch) and the Indian Legal Service (Grade I) cannot be considered for appointment as judicial members as provided in sub-sections (2)(c) and (d) of Section 10-FD. The expertise in Company Law Service or the Indian Legal Service will at best enable them to be considered for appointment as technical members. (ii) As NCLT takes over the functions of the High Court, the members should as nearly as possible have the same position and status as High Court Judges. This can be achieved, not by giving the salary and perks of a High Court Judge to the members, but by ensuring that persons who are as nearly equal in rank, experience or competence to High Court Judges are appointed as members. Therefore, only officers who are holding the ranks of Secretaries or Additional Secretaries alone can be considered for appointment as technical members of the National Company Law Tribunal. Clauses (c) and (d) of sub-section (2) and clauses (a) and (b) of sub-section (3) of Section 10-FD which provide for persons with 15 years experience in Group A post or persons holding the post of Joint Secretary or equivalent post in the 22Central or the State Government, being qualified for appointment as Members of Tribunal, are invalid (iii) A “technical member” presupposes an experience in the field to which the Tribunal relates. A member of the Indian Company Law Service who has worked with Accounts Branch or officers in other departments who might have incidentally dealt with some aspect of company law cannot be considered as “experts” qualified to be appointed as technical members. Therefore clauses (a) and (b) of sub-section (3) are not valid. (iv) The first part of clause (f) of sub-section (3) providing that any person having special knowledge or professional experience of 20 years in science, technology, economics, banking, industry could be considered to be persons with expertise in company law, for being appointed as technical members in the Company Law Tribunal, is invalid. (v)  Persons  having  ability,  integrity,  standing  and  special  knowledge  and professional experience of not less than fifteen years in industrial finance, industrial management, industrial reconstruction, investment and accountancy, may however be considered as persons having expertise in rehabilitation/revival of companies and therefore, eligible for being considered for appointment as technical members. (vi) In regard to category of persons referred in clause (g) of sub-section (3) at least five years\\' experience should be specified. (vii) Only clauses (c), (d), (e), (g), (h), and the latter part of clause (f) in sub-section (3) of Section 10-FD and officers of civil services of the rank of the Secretary or Additional Secretary in the Indian Company Law Service and the Indian Legal Service can be considered for purposes of appointment as technical members of the Tribunal. (viii) Instead of a five-member Selection Committee with the Chief Justice of India (or his nominee) as Chairperson and two Secretaries from the Ministry of Finance and Company Affairs and the Secretary in the Ministry of Labour and the Secretary in the Ministry of Law and Justice as members mentioned in Section 10-FX, the Selection Committee should broadly be on the following lines: a. Chief Justice of India or his nominee—Chairperson (with a casting vote); b. A Senior Judge of the Supreme Court or Chief Justice of High Court—Member; c. Secretary in the Ministry of Finance and Company Affairs—Member; and d. Secretary in the Ministry of Law and Justice—Member. (ix) The term of office of three years shall be changed to a term of seven or five years subject to eligibility for appointment for one more term. This is because considerable time is required to achieve expertise in the field concerned. A term of three years is very short and by the time the members achieve the required knowledge, expertise and efficiency, one term will be over. Further the said term of three years with the retirement age of 65 years is perceived as having been tailor-made for persons who have retired or shortly to retire and encourages these Tribunals to be treated as post-retirement havens. If these Tribunals are to function effectively and efficiently they should be able to attract younger members who will have a reasonable period of service. (x) The second proviso to Section 10-FE enabling the President and members to retain  lien  with  their  parent  cadre/ministry/department  while  holding  office  as President or Members will not be conducive for the independence of members. Any 23person appointed as member should be prepared to totally disassociate himself from the executive. The lien cannot therefore exceed a period of one year. (xi) To maintain independence and security in service, sub-section (3) of Section 10-FJ and Section 10-FV should provide that suspension of the President/Chairman or member of a Tribunal can be only with the concurrence of the Chief Justice of India. (xii) The administrative support for all Tribunals should be from the Ministry of Law and Justice. Neither the Tribunals nor their members shall seek or be provided with facilities  from  the  respective  sponsoring  or  parent  Ministries  or  Department concerned. (xiii) Two-member Benches of the Tribunal should always have a judicial member. Whenever any larger or special Benches are constituted, the number of technical members shall not exceed the judicial members.” 50.  Later, in Madras Bar Association vs. Union of India (2014)17,  whilst striking down the newly-created National Tax Tribunal under the National Tax Tribunals Act, 2005, it was observed that procedure of appointment and conditions of service of members must be akin to judges of the Courts which were sought to be substituted by the Tribunal(s).  51.  Only persons with professional legal qualifications coupled with substantial experience in law were held to be competent to handle complex legal issues. It was further held that a litigating party (Govt.) should never be a participant in the appointment  process  of  members  of  the  Tribunal.  Similarly,  a  provision  for reappointment or extension of tenure is ipso facto prejudicial to the independence of the members of Tribunal. A difference was also drawn between appointments to Tribunals which substituted Courts of first instance and to those which were not subordinate to High Courts.  52.  It was further reiterated that establishment of a Tribunal with its seat at Delhi could cause hardship to litigants from other parts of the country, depriving them of  17 (2014) 10 SCC 1. 24convenient access to justice. Moreover, the Court held that in order to uphold their independence and fairness it would be inappropriate for the Central Government to have any administrative control over members of the Tribunal. 53.  In  Madras  Bar  Association  vs.  Union  of  India  (2015)18,  vires  of  the Companies Act, 2013 which contemplated establishment of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) were challenged. Interestingly, while examining Chapter XXVII of Companies Act, 2013 i.e. Sections 407 to 434, this Court held that although the establishment of NCLT and NCLAT was not unconstitutional but there was a need for curing defects in accordance with the dictum of R. Gandhi (supra). 54.  Finally, in Gujarat Urja Vikas Ltd. vs. Essar Power Ltd.19, while examining the composition and working of Tribunals and statutory framework thereof, this Court reiterated its earlier decisions in L. Chandra Kumar (supra) and Madras Bar Association (2014) (supra), observing that remedy of appeal to this Court was in effect, being obliterated due to cost and inaccessibility. In addition to this, a flood of appeals from all the Tribunals directly to this Court hindered its efficiency in fulfilling its primary Constitutional role. Since appellate tribunals, manned by non-judicial members, were adjudging complex questions of law, the composition of Tribunals  was  put  under  review  by  this  Court  and  a  reference  to  the  Law Commission  of  India  was  made  in  this  regard.  Pursuant  to  this,  the  Law Commission  of  India,  in  its  272nd  Report  titled  ‘Assessment  of  Statutory  18 (2015) 8 SCC 583. 19 (2016) 9 SCC 103. 25Frameworks of Tribunals in India’ gave a detailed analysis of statutory framework with respect to Tribunalisation in India.  THE FINANCE ACT, 2017: ITS LEGISLATIVE BACKGROUND 55.  Primary challenge in the present batch of cases is to the Finance Act, 2017. Though this enactment was purportedly to give effect to “the finance proposals of the central government for the financial year 2017-18” but Part XIV thereof consists of comprehensive provisions meant to effect “Amendments to Central Acts to Provide for Merger of Tribunals and other Authorities and Conditions of Service of Chairpersons, Members, etc”. 56.  A scrutiny of Part XIV of the Finance Act, 2017 discloses how by virtue of Sections 158 to 182, Parliament has amended twenty-five central enactments which form the foundation for multiple Tribunals. It has been submitted by the learned Attorney General, these amendments seek to rationalise the functioning of Tribunals, in conformity with the principles laid down by this Court in its prior decisions. 57.  Sections 158 to 182 of Part-XIV are broadly in pari materia except that each Section deals with a separate Tribunal.  In order to comprehend the manner in which  Parliament  has  sought  to  achieve  a  uniform  pattern  of  qualifications, appointment, term of office, salaries and allowances, resignation, removal and other terms and conditions of service of members and presiding officers of various Tribunals, it would be sufficient to illustratively reproduce Sections 158 and 173 of Part XIV of the Finance Act, 2017. Section 173 reads as follows:  26\"I.—AMENDMENT TO THE CINEMATOGRAPH ACT, 1952 173. In the Cinematograph Act, 1952, after section 5D, the following section shall be inserted, namely:—  \"5E. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, the qualifications, appointment, term of office, salaries and allowances, resignation, removal and the other terms and conditions of service of the Chairman and other members of the Appellate Tribunal appointed after the commencement of Part XIV of Chapter VI of the Finance Act, 2017, shall be governed by the provisions of section 184 of that Act: Provided that the Chairman and member appointed before the commencement of Part XIV of Chapter VI of the Finance Act, 2017, shall continue to be governed by the provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder as if the provisions of section 184 of the Finance Act, 2017 had not come into force.\". 58.  In addition to this, some Sections in Part XIV also amalgamate existing Tribunals.  Section  158  has  been  reproduced  below  as  an  example  of  such Sections  which  in  addition  to  the  elements  of  Section  173  also  effect amalgamations: “158. Amendment of Act 14 of 1947.— In the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947,— (a) in Section 7A, after sub-section (1), the following sub-section shall be inserted, namely:— “(1A) The Industrial Tribunal constituted by the Central Government under sub-section (1) shall also exercise, on and from the commencement of Part XIV of Chapter VI of the Finance Act, 2017, the jurisdiction, powers and authority conferred on the Tribunal referred to in Section 7D of the Employees\\' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 (19 of 1952).”; (b) after Section 7C, the following section shall be inserted, namely:— “7D.  Qualifications,  terms  and  conditions  of  service  of  Presiding  Officer.— Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, the qualifications, appointment, term of office, salaries and allowances, resignation and removal and other terms and conditions of service of the Presiding Officer of the Industrial Tribunal appointed by the Central Government under sub-section (1) of Section 7A, shall, after the commencement of Part XIV of Chapter VI of the Finance Act, 2017, be governed by the provisions of Section 184 of that Act: Provided that the Presiding Officer appointed before the commencement of Part XIV of Chapter VI of the Finance Act, 2017, shall continue to be governed by the provisions of this Act, and the rules made thereunder as if the provisions of Section 184 of the Finance Act, 2017 had not come into force.” 59.  There  are  two  significant  expressions  worth  noticing  in  these  similarly worded Sections 158 to 182. First, every such Section opens up with a non-obstante clause and it provides that “notwithstanding anything contained in …… 27Act  the  qualifications,  appointment,  term  of  office,  salaries  and  allowances, resignation, removal and the other terms and conditions of service of the Chairman and other members of the Appellate Tribunal appointed after the commencement of Part XIV of Chapter VI of the Finance Act, 2017, shall be governed by the provisions of section 184 of that Act”. Second, Section 184 of the Finance Act overrides all other provisions in both the Finance Act, 2017 as well as the other twenty-five enactments which stand amended.  60.  To critical analyse the intention of the legislature in enacting Section 184, reference must be made to the immediately preceding Section 183 which is to be found in sub-part ‘S’ of the Act titled “Conditions of service of Chairpersons and members of Tribunals, Appellate Tribunals and other Authorities”. Since Sections 183 and 184 would need to be read conjointly, both are reproduced below: “S.—CONDITIONS  OF  SERVICE  OF  CHAIRPERSON  AND  MEMBERS  OF TRIBUNALS, APPELLATE TRIBUNALS AND OTHER AUTHORITIES 183. Application of Section 184.— Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the provisions of the Acts specified in column (3) of the Eighth Schedule, on and from the appointed day, provisions of Section 184 shall apply to the Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson, Chairman, Vice-Chairman, President, Vice-President, Presiding Officer or Member of the Tribunal, Appellate Tribunal or, as the case may be, other Authorities as specified in column (2) of the said Schedule: Provided that the provisions of Section 184 shall not apply to the Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson,  Chairman,  Vice-Chairman,  President,  Vice-President,  Presiding Officer or, as the case may be, Member holding such office as such immediately before the appointed day. 184. Qualifications, appointment, term and conditions of service, salary and allowances, etc., of Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson and Members, etc., of the Tribunal,  Appellate  Tribunal  and  other  Authorities.—  (1)  The  Central Government  may,  by  notification,  make  rules  to  provide  for  qualifications, appointment, term of office, salaries and allowances, resignation, removal and the other  terms  and  conditions  of  service  of  the  Chairperson,  Vice-Chairperson, Chairman, Vice-Chairman, President, Vice-President, Presiding Officer or Member of the Tribunal, Appellate Tribunal or, as the case may be, other Authorities as specified in column (2) of the Eighth Schedule: Provided  that  the  Chairperson,  Vice-Chairperson,  Chairman,  Vice-Chairman, President, Vice-President, Presiding Officer or Member of the Tribunal, Appellate 28Tribunal or other Authority shall hold office for such term as specified in the rules made by the Central Government but not exceeding five years from the date on which he enters upon his office and shall be eligible for reappointment: Provided further that no Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson, Chairman, Vice-Chairman, President, Vice-President, Presiding Officer or Member shall hold office as such after he has attained such age as specified in the rules made by the Central Government which shall not exceed,— (a) in the case of Chairperson, Chairman  [President or the Presiding Officer of the Securities Appellate Tribunal], the age of seventy years; (b) in the case of Vice-Chairperson, Vice-Chairman, Vice-President, Presiding Officer [of the Industrial Tribunal constituted by the Central Government and the Debts Recovery Tribunal] or any other Member, the age of sixty-seven years: (2) Neither the salary and allowances nor the other terms and conditions of service of  Chairperson,  Vice-Chairperson,  Chairman,  Vice-Chairman,  President,  Vice-President, Presiding Officer or Member of the Tribunal, Appellate Tribunal or, as the case  may  be,  other  Authority  may  be  varied  to  his  disadvantage  after  his appointment.” 61.  Further, the Central Government in purported exercise of its powers under the aforementioned provisions, has notified the ‘Tribunal, Appellate Tribunal and other Authorities (Qualifications, Experience and other Conditions of Service of Members) Rules, 2017’ [in short “the Rules”].  PETITIONERS’ CASE : 62.  The pleadings and arguments in most of the individual cases are similar and overlapping. Hence, for the sake of brevity, it is not necessary to refer to the submissions of each of the counsel individually. Broadly, however, petitioners have questioned the validity of Part XIV read with the 8th and 9th Schedules of the Finance  Act  2017,  as  being  ex-facie  unconstitutional,  arbitrary,  in  colourable exercise  of  legislative  power,  and  offensive  to  the  basic  structure  of  the Constitution.  63.  The foremost contention on behalf of the petitioners is that Part-XIV could not and ought not to have been made part of the Finance Act, 2017 as the said 29part is not classifiable as a ‘money bill’. Emphasis was placed on the wordings of Article 110 which allows those bills which contain “only” provisions which fall within the metes and bounds of Clauses (a) to (g) thereof, to be treated as ‘money bill’. By virtue of inclusion of Part XIV, the entirety of the Finance Act, 2017 was contended to have lost its colour as a ‘money bill’ under Article 110 and hence its passage without the assent of the Rajya Sabha as required under Article 107 renders it ultra vires the legislative scheme contemplated in the Constitution.  64.  Learned counsels vehemently placed reliance on the Constituent Assembly Debates to lend strength to the importance of the expression “only” under Article 110(1). They seek to make out a case that such phraseology was deliberately incorporated in the Constitution by making a conscious departure from Section 37 of the Government of India Act, 1935. Inclusion of Part XIV in the Finance Act, 2017 is shown as being an act of camouflage and a colourable exercise and petitioners assert that such indirect manner of bypassing of the Rajya Sabha is impermissible. A larger narrative was presented before this Court, that is, of the Central  Government  undermining  the  character  and  essence  of  a  bicameral legislature as envisaged under the Constitution; and interference of this Court was sought through examination of the substance of the legislation and not mere acceptance of the nomenclature accorded by the Lok Sabha Speaker under Article 110(3).  65.  A  nuanced  argument  was  also  furthered  by  petitioners’  counsels  who highlighted  that  Tribunals  are  governed  by  Article  323-A  and  323-B  of  the Constitution and laws enacted in this regard cannot be classified as money bills. Further, Parliament in making changes to Tribunals can trace its competence to 30Entry 11-A of List III of the Constitution which deals with administration of justice, and not financial matters. 66.  Part XIV was also impugned for its effect of terminating the services of presiding  officers  and  members  of  various  now-defunct  Tribunals,  which  was claimed as being a direct interference in the independence of the judiciary.  67.  Section 184(1) of the Finance Act, 2017, in so far as it empowers the Central Government  to  make  rules  to  provide  for  qualifications  and  procedure  of appointment, conditions of service, terms and salaries was contended to suffer from the vice of excessive delegation. It was stated that the said provision takes away all judicial safeguards and makes the Tribunals amenable to the whims and fancies of the largest litigant, the State. This was contended as being against the grain  of  the  Constitution,  besides  affecting  administration  of  justice.  In  the alternative, counsels also contended that the present formulation of Rules under Section 184 was ultra vires the parent enactment and the binding dictum expressed by this Court in a catena of judgments. 68.  Further, during the course of arguments, various other deficiencies and contradictions in the administration of Tribunals and certain anomalous situations like providing direct appeals to this Court were highlighted, which were contended as being against the spirit of the Constitution. Petitioners, in addition to challenging the vires of the Finance Act, 2017 also prayed for a mandamus directing the State to mandatorily conduct ‘Judicial Impact Assessment’ of legislations.    31UNION OF INDIA’S CASE : 69.  Learned Attorney General, on the other hand, passionately drew attention to  the  existence  of  over  40  tribunals,  statutory  commissions,  and  authorities functioning under the Government of India, each of which has been established under a different enactment and is governed by different set of rules. As a result, the conditions of service, modes of appointment, tenures etc. of members and presiding officers in different Tribunals were shown as vastly varying from one to another, giving rise to several anomalies and distortions. He put forth multiple examples; like how while members of some of the Commissions/Tribunals enjoy the status of Supreme Court judges, others like the members of the Debt Recovery Tribunal have only been kept at par with District Court judges. Similarly, while a person once appointed to the ITAT can continue till the age of superannuation, tenures of persons appointed to the APTEL was merely three years. The Attorney General attributed such inconsistencies as drafting errors and further stressed the need  to  streamline  and  harmonise  the  applicable  rules,  which  is  what  was attempted through the Finance Act, 2017. 70.  He also highlighted the inherent contradiction in according status and rank equivalent to that of Constitutional Court judges to members and presiding officers of such Tribunals and regulatory bodies.  It was argued that the two have different functions and roles in our Constitutional setup. While the Supreme Court had a strength of 31 judges (when the matter was argued), he pointed out, that there are more than 50 functionaries enjoying the conditions of service of a Supreme Court judge and more than 150 such functionaries who have been brought at par with High  Court  judges.  After  placing  on  record  multiple  problems  arising  in  the 32administration of justice as a result of such practice, he advocated the need to keep ‘rank’ and ‘status’ separate from ‘salary’ and ‘allowances’.  71.  Learned Attorney General further relied upon an order passed by this Court in Rajiv Garg vs. Union of India (WP No. 120 of 2017) on 08th February, 2013 directing that a decision be taken by the Central Government on uniformity of service conditions in various tribunals. Reliance was also placed on the 13th Report of  the  2nd  Administrative  Reforms  Commission  submitted  in  April  2009  which recommended greater uniformity in service conditions in various tribunals. It was pointed out that, in fact, the Tribunals, Appellate Tribunals and other Authorities (Conditions of Service) Bill, 2014 was introduced in the Rajya Sabha on 14th February,  2014  but  somehow  could  not  be  passed.  Introducing  separate amendments  for  each  of  these  Tribunals  would  have  been  unwieldy  and impractical, besides resulting in several inconsistencies. Resultantly, he submits a holistic view was taken and a single enactment was sought to be introduced in order to harmoniously bring uniformity.  72.  On behalf of the Union, the petitioners’ contentions were elaborately refuted. It was submitted that it is a settled principle of Constitutional interpretation that terms of the Constitution, including Clauses (a) to (g) of Article 110(1), must be interpreted  in  their  widest  amplitude,  with  the  result  that  when  the  principal enactment had the dominant character of a ‘money bill’, all matters incidental thereto and inserted therein would also draw the colour and characteristic of a ‘money bill’. 3373.  In the alternative, he took aid of Clause (3) of Article 110 to contend that the Speaker of the Lok Sabha was the final and only Constitutional authority to adjudge the nature of a bill sought to be introduced under Article 109. Such decision was both final and hence not subject to any judicial review by any Court; even otherwise such  exercise  of  passing  legislations  and  certifications  by  the  Speaker  were “proceedings in Parliament” and could hence “not be called in question” before this Court in view of Article 122(1).  74.  Both sides have extensively relied upon case law and Constitutional history to substantiate their respective pleas. Relevant portions of the same are being referred to in the latter parts of this judgment whenever necessary.  BRIEF REFERENCE TO INTERLOCUTORY ORDERS : 75.  After  considering  the  suggestions  filed  during  the  course  of  hearing  in SLP(C) No. 15804/2017, this Court passed an interim order on 9 February 2018, suggesting: \"1. Staying the composition of Search-cum-Selection Committee as prescribed in Column 4 of the Schedule to the Tribunal, Appellate Tribunal and Other Authorities (Qualification, experience and other conditions of service of members) Rules, 2017 both in respect of Chairman/Judicial Members and Administrative Members. A further direction to constitute an interim Search-cum- Selection Committee during the pendency of this W.P. in respect of both Judicial/Administrative members as under : a.  Chief Justice of India or his nominee - Chairman  b.  Chairman of the Central Administrative Tribunal - Member  c.  Two Secretaries nominated by the Government of India - Members 2. Appointment to the post of Chairman shall be made by nomination by the Chief Justice of India. 3. Stay the terms of office of 3 years as prescribed in Column 5 of the Schedule to the Tribunal, Appellate Tribunal and other Authorities (Qualification, experience and other conditions of service of members) Rules, 2017. A further direction fixing the term of office of all selectees by the aforementioned interim Search-cum- Selection Committee and consequent appointees as 5 years. 344. All appointments to be made in pursuance to the selection made by the interim Search-cum-Selection Committee shall be with conditions of service as applicable to the Judges of High Court. 5. A further direction to the effect that all the selections made by the aforementioned interim selection committee and the consequential appointment of all the selectees as Chairman/Judicial/Administrative members for a term of 5 years with conditions of service as applicable to Judges of High Court shall not be affected by the final outcome of the Writ Petition.” 76.  The learned Attorney General agreed with all except the fourth and fifth suggestions reproduced above, and suggested certain modifications as follows: “4. All appointments to be made in pursuance to the selection made by the interim Search-cum-Selection Committee shall abide by the conditions of service as per the old Acts and the Rules. 5. A further direction to the effect that all the selections made by the aforementioned interim selection committee and the consequential appointment of all the selectees as Chairman/Judicial/Administrative members shall be for a period as has been provided in the old Acts and the Rules.” 77.  This  Court  agreed  to  the  learned  Attorney  General’s  suggestions  and accordingly made the following operative directions: “In view of the aforesaid, we accept the suggestions and direct that the same shall be  made  applicable  for  selection  of  the  Chairpersons  and  the Judicial/Administrative/ Technical/Expert Members for all tribunals.” 78.  Since many of the Search-cum-Selection Committees had initiated selection processes and had completed a substantial portion of the exercise prior to the above order dated 9th February, 2018, this Court, on 12th February, 2018 passed the following order: “As some Committees had proceeded, the matter was listed for further hearing. We have heard learned counsel for the parties. Mr. Rohit Bhat, learned counsel assisting the learned Attorney General for the Union of India shall file the status of the selection process by the Committees, by 13.2.2018. Mr. Arvind Datar, Mr. C.A. Sundaram and Mr. Mohan Parasaran, learned senior counsel shall also file through their Advocates-on- Record a joint memorandum with regard to which tribunals are covered and not covered. The same shall be filed by 10.30 a.m. on 13.2.2018. Orders reserved.” 3579.  Further, vide order dated 20th March 2018, this Court clarified its previous order of 9th  February 2018 and directed: “(iii) The tenure of the Chairperson and the Judicial/Administrative/Expert/Technical \\nMembers of all the Tribunals shall be for a period of five years or the maximum age \\nthat was fixed/determined under the old Acts and Rules;” \\n80.  The following directions were also issued on 16th July, 2018 with regard to \\nthe age of superannuation of Members of the ITAT: \\n“At this juncture, we may note that there is some confusion with regard to the Income \\nTax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) as regards the age of superannuation. We make it \\nclear that the person selected as Member of the ITAT will continue till the age of 62 \\nyears and the person holding the post of President, shall continue till the age of 65 \\nyears.” \\n81.  Corollary to the order dated 16th July 2018, six officers who had been \\nselected  as  Member  (Judicial)  in  CESTAT,  also  demanded  the  age  of \\nsuperannuation as noted in the case of Members of ITAT, to be applicable to them. \\nFollowing  the  same  dictum,  vide  order  dated  21st  August  2018,  clarification \\nregarding the age of superannuation for Members of CESTAT, Armed Forces \\nTribunal and Central Administrative Tribunal was made. The relevant portion of \\nthat order reads as follows: \\n“CESTAT: \\n2. In IA 113281 of 2018, the applicant is an Additional District and Sessions Judge \\nin the State of West Bengal, who has been selected as Member (Judicial) in the \\nCESTAT. The notification of appointment of six officers who have been selected as \\nMember (Judicial), including the applicant, stipulates that they shall hold office for a \\nperiod of five years or till attaining the age of 62 years, whichever is earlier “in terms \\nof the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s order dated 20 March 2018”. A member of the \\njudicial service would have ordinarily continued until the date of superannuation in \\nthe state judicial service, subject to the service rules. It would be manifestly \\ninappropriate to adopt an interpretation as a result of which, upon assuming office \\nas Member (Judicial) in CESTAT the officer will have a tenure which will expire after \\nfive years, if it falls prior to attaining the age of 62 years. We, accordingly, are of the \\nview that the clarification issued for the ITAT in the order dated 20 March 2018 \\nneeds to be reiterated in the case of the members of the CESTAT, which we do. We \\nclarify that a person selected as Member of the CESTAT will continue until the age \\nof 62 years while a person holding the post of President shall continue until the age \\nof 65 years. \\n36AFT: \\n3. Members of the Armed Forces Tribunal shall hold office until the attainment of the \\nage of 65 years. Chairpersons who have been former Judges of the Supreme Court \\nshall hold office until the attainment of the age of 70 years. \\nCAT: \\n4. In the case  of the Central Administrative Tribunal,  we clarify that the  old \\nrules/provisions shall continue to apply.” \\n \\nCONCEPT NOTE OF LEARNED AMICUS CURIAE : \\n82.  On the request of this Court, learned Senior Advocate Arvind Datar has \\nprovided invaluable assistance as the Amicus Curiae. In his detailed Concept Note, \\nhe has stressed the need for setting up an independent oversight body in light of \\nthe observations in L. Chandra Kumar (supra), and as reiterated in Madras Bar \\nAssociation v. Union of India (2015) (supra) to the effect that Tribunals or their \\nmembers should not be required to seek facilities from the sponsoring or parent \\nministries or concerned departments. \\n83.  The Concept Note also emphasised the need to implement the ‘74th Report \\nof the Parliamentary Standing Committee’ which recommended the creation of a \\n`National Tribunal Commission’ (NTC) to oversee all the Tribunals in the country. \\nMr. Datar further suggests that such National Tribunal Commission may consist of \\nthe following:  \\n•  Two retired Supreme Court Judges (with the senior-most amongst them \\nto be Chairman). \\n•  Two retired High Court Judges (Members). \\n•  Three members representing the Executive. \\n3784.  It is further suggested in the concept note that such members be appointed \\nby the following Selection Committee : \\n•  Chief Justice of India (as Chairperson of the Committee who exercises a \\ncasting vote); \\n•  Two senior-most judges of the Supreme Court after the Chief Justice of \\nIndia; \\n•  Current Law Minister; and \\n•  Leader of the opposition. \\n85.  The Concept Note also contains the following suggestions: \\n•  The NTC should oversee functioning of central Tribunals and similar body \\nmay be constituted for State Tribunals. \\n•  The NTC should deal with appointment and removal of members of the \\nTribunals by constituting sub-committees.   \\n•  The member of the Tribunals should be recruited by national competition.  \\nOnce recruited they should continue till the age of 62/65 years subject to \\ntheir efficiency and satisfactory working. \\n•  The Tribunals should not be haven for retired persons and appointment \\nprocess should not result in decisions being influenced if the Government \\nitself is a litigant and the appointing authority at the same time. \\n•  There  should  be  restriction  on  acceptance  of  any  employment  after \\nretirement. \\n•  Bypassing of High Court jurisdiction under Article 226/227 need to be \\nremedied by statutory amendment excluding direct appeals to this Court. \\n38•  There should be proper mechanism for removal of members. \\n86.  The  aforementioned  Concept  Note  of  Learned  Amicus  Curiae  was \\nconsidered by this Court on 07.05.2018, resulting in the following observations:- \\n“We broadly approve the concept of having an effective and autonomous oversight \\nbody for all the Tribunals with such exceptions as may be inevitable. Such body \\nshould be responsible for recruitments and oversight of functioning of members of \\nthe Tribunals. Regular cadre for Tribunals may be necessary. Learned amicus \\nsuggests setting up of all India Tribunal service on the pattern of U.K. The members \\ncan be drawn either from the serving officers in Higher Judicial Service or directly \\nrecruited with appropriate qualifications by national competition. Their performance \\nand functioning must be reviewed by an independent body in the same was as \\nsuperintendence by the High Court under Article 235 of the Constitution. Direct \\nappeals must be checked. Members of the Tribunals should not only be eligible for \\nappointment to the High Courts but a mechanism should be considered whereby \\ndue consideration is given to them on the same pattern on which it is given to the \\nmembers of Higher Judicial Service. This may help the High Courts to have requisite \\ntalent to deal with issues which arise from decisions of Tribunals. A regular cadre \\nfor the Tribunals can be on the pattern of cadres for the judiciary. The objective of \\nsetting up of Tribunals to have speedy and inexpensive justice will not in any manner \\nbe hampered in doing so. Wherever there is only one seat of the Tribunal, its \\nBenches should be available either in all states or at least in all regions wherever \\nthere is litigation instead of only one place.”      \\n87.  On 07.05.2018 itself, the following additional issues were also suggested for \\nconsideration: \\n“(i) Creation of a regular cadres laying down eligibility for recruitment for Tribunals;  \\n(ii) Setting up of an autonomous oversight body for recruitment and overseeing the \\nperformance and discipline of the members so recruited and other issues relating \\nthereto; \\n(iii) Amending the scheme of direct appeals to this Court so that the orders of \\nTribunals are subject to jurisdiction of the High Courts; \\n(iv)  Making  Benches  of  Tribunals  accessible  to  common  man  at  convenient \\nlocations instead of having only one location at Delhi or elsewhere. In the alternative, \\nconferring jurisdiction on existing courts as special Courts or Tribunals.” \\n88.  Thereafter, this Court opined the following recourse :- \\n“20. The above issues may require urgent setting up of a committee, preferably of \\nthree members, one of whom must be retired judge of this Court who may be served \\nin a Tribunal. Such Committee can have inter action with all stakeholders and \\nsuggest a mechanism consistent with the constitutional scheme as interpreted by \\nthis  Court  in  several  decisions  referred  to  above  and  also  in  the  light  of \\n39recommendations of expert bodies. This exercise must be undertaken in a time \\nbound manner.” \\n89.  This was followed by yet another order of 16th May, 2018 recommending \\nconstitution of a Committee within two months and expecting the Committee to \\ngive its report within three months thereafter. \\nFORMULATION OF ISSUES: \\n90.  The core issues canvassed at the Bar concern the constitutionality of the \\nFinance Act, 2017, particularly whether it satisfies the test of a ‘money bill’ under \\nArticle 110 of the Constitution? Further, in the eventuality that it is held that the \\nimpugned legislation has been validly enacted, then does it through Section 184 \\nexcessively delegate legislative power to the Executive? Finally, whether the Rules \\nthus framed as delegated legislation are ultra vires their parent enactments and \\nare liable to be struck down?  \\n91.  In addition, learned Counsel for the parties have drawn attention to the need \\nto rationalise the administration of Tribunals, especially the conditions of service, \\nmode of appointment, security of tenure and requisite qualifications of members \\nand presiding officers of various Tribunals.  They have also highlighted the growing \\nmenace of pendency before this Court arising from direct statutory appeals from \\norders of such Tribunals.   \\n92.  In  light  of  these  arguments  put  forth  by  learned  Counsels  and  the \\nsuggestions  of  by  the  Amicus  Curiae,  the  following  issues  arise  for  our \\nconsideration: \\n40I.  Whether  the  ‘Finance  Act,  2017’  insofar  as  it  amends  certain  other \\nenactments and alters conditions of service of persons manning different \\nTribunals  can  be  termed  as  a  ‘money  bill’  under  Article  110  and \\nconsequently is validly enacted? \\nII.  If the answer to the above is in the affirmative then Whether Section 184 of \\nthe  Finance  Act,  2017  is  unconstitutional  on  account  of  Excessive \\nDelegation? \\nIII.  If  Section  184  is  valid,  Whether  Tribunal,  Appellate  Tribunal  and  other \\nAuthorities (Qualifications, Experience and other Conditions of Service of \\nMembers) Rules, 2017 are in consonance with the Principal Act and various \\ndecisions of this Court on functioning of Tribunals? \\nIV.  Whether there should be a Single Nodal Agency for administration of all \\nTribunals? \\nV.  Whether there is a need for conducting a Judicial Impact Assessment of all \\nTribunals in India? \\nVI.   Whether judges of Tribunals set up by Acts of Parliament under Articles \\n323-A and 323-B of the Constitution can be equated in ‘rank’ and ‘status’ \\nwith Constitutional functionaries? \\nVII.  Whether direct statutory appeals from Tribunals to the Supreme Court ought \\nto be detoured? \\nVIII.  Whether there is a need for amalgamation of existing Tribunals and setting \\nup of benches. \\n41ISSUE I: WHETHER THE ‘FINANCE ACT, 2017’ INSOFAR AS IT AMENDS CERTAIN OTHER \\nENACTMENTS AND ALTERS CONDITIONS OF SERVICE OF PERSONS MANNING DIFFERENT \\nTRIBUNALS  CAN  BE  TERMED  AS  A  ‘MONEY  BILL’  UNDER  ARTICLE  110  AND \\nCONSEQUENTLY IS VALIDLY ENACTED? \\n93.  The Indian Parliament is a bicameral legislature. In order to become law, as \\nper the general legislative scheme as provided under Article 107, an ordinary bill \\nmust be passed by a simple majority of both the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha \\nand must then receive Presidential ratification. Ordinary bills can be introduced \\neither by the government or by any private member in either house of Parliament. \\nAfter securing requisite majority in the House it is introduced in, ordinary bills are \\nthen sent to the other House for its assent. The Constitution, however, makes two \\nexemptions to this general legislative procedure for formulation of laws. \\n94.  Article 368 provides for the Constituent power of the Parliament to amend \\nthe Constitution itself and concomitantly requires a higher threshold of majority in \\nboth houses of Parliament, and in certain cases also require the assent of a simple \\nmajority  of  the  State  legislatures.  Article  110,  in  stark  contrast,  reverses  the \\nthreshold and significantly reduces the role of the Rajya Sabha for ‘money bills’.  \\nArticles 109 and 110 provide that: \\n“109. (1) A Money Bill shall not be introduced in the Council of States.  \\n(2) After a Money Bill has been passed by the House of the People it shall be \\ntransmitted to the Council of States for its recommendations and the Council of \\nStates shall within a period of fourteen days from the date of its receipt of the Bill \\nreturn the Bill to the House of the People with its recommendations and the House \\nof  the  People  may  thereupon  either  accept  or  reject  all  or  any  of  the \\nrecommendations of the Council of States.  \\n(3) If the House of the People accepts any of the recommendations of the Council \\nof States, the Money Bill shall be deemed to have been passed by both Houses \\n42with  the  amendments  recommended  by  the  Council  of \\nStates and accepted by the House of the People. \\n(4) If the House of the People does not accept any of the recommendations of the \\nCouncil of States, the Money Bill shall be deemed to have been passed by both \\nHouses in the form in which it was passed by the House of the People without any \\nof the amendments recommended by the Council of States.  \\n(5) If a Money Bill passed by the House of the People and transmitted to the Council \\nof States for its recommendations is not returned to the House of the People within \\nthe said  period of fourteen days, it shall be deemed to have been passed by both \\nHouses at the expiration of the said period in the form in which it was passed by the \\nHouse of the People. \\n110. (1) For the purposes of this Chapter, a Bill shall be deemed to be a Money Bill \\nif it contains only provisions dealing with all or any of the following  matters, \\nnamely:— \\n(a) the imposition, abolition, remission, alteration or regulation of any tax; \\n(b) the regulation of the borrowing of money or the giving of any guarantee by the \\nGovernment of India, or the amendment of the law with respect to any financial \\nobligations undertaken or to be undertaken by the Government of India; \\n(c) the custody of the Consolidated Fund or the Contingency Fund of India, the \\npayment of moneys into or the withdrawal of moneys from any such Fund;  \\n(d) the appropriation of moneys out of the Consolidated Fund of India;  \\n(e) the declaring of any expenditure to be expenditure charged on the Consolidated \\nFund of India or the increasing of the amount of any such expenditure;  \\n(f) the receipt of money on account of the Consolidated Fund of India or the public \\naccount of India or the custody or issue of such money or the audit of the accounts \\nof the Union or of a State; or  \\n(g) any matter incidental to any of the matters specified in sub-clauses (a) to (f).  \\n(2) A Bill shall not be deemed to be a Money Bill by reason only that it provides for \\nthe imposition of fines or other pecuniary penalties, or for the demand or payment \\nof fees for licences or fees for services rendered, or by reason that it provides for \\nthe imposition, abolition, remission, alteration or regulation of any tax by any local \\nauthority or body for local purposes. \\n(3) If any question arises whether a Bill is a Money Bill or not, the decision of the \\nSpeaker of the House of the People thereon shall be final.  \\n(4) There shall be endorsed on every Money Bill when it is transmitted to the Council \\nof States under article 109, and when it is presented to the President for assent \\nunder article 111, the certificate of the Speaker of the House of the People signed \\nby him that it is a Money Bill.” \\n95.   ‘Money bills’ as defined under Article 110(1) thus include bills which contain \\n“only” provisions covered by sub-clauses (a) to (g). These money bills can be \\nintroduced only in the Lok Sabha and the role of the Rajya Sabha is merely \\nconsultative. Unlike in the case of ordinary bills where the Upper House can block \\n43the proposed legislation and act as a check on the power of the directly elected \\nLower House, in case of money bills, the Rajya Sabha merely has the ability to \\nrecommend amendments, that too only within fourteen days. In case the Lok \\nSabha refuses to accept those recommendations or in case no recommendations \\nare made by the Rajya Sabha within the period of fourteen days, the money bill \\ncan be directly sent for Presidential ratification and thereafter it becomes valid law.  \\n96.  Such an exceptional provision has its roots in British tradition and is an \\ninheritance of the Westminster form of government. The Parliament Act of 1911 \\nwas formulated by the United Kingdom Parliament in response to the Constitutional \\ncrisis of 1909 whereby the unelected Upper House (House of Lords) had stalled \\nimportant  budgetary  bills  passed  by  the  elected  Lower  House  (House  of \\nCommons), causing a governmental crisis and forcing the elected government to \\nresign and seek re-election. Through Section 3, the said enactment required the \\nSpeaker of the House of Commons to certify that the bill was a ‘money bill’ and \\npost such certification, the Upper House would forfeit its ability to amend or veto \\nthe bill. Further, it also allowed ‘public bills’ to become law irrespective of refusal \\nby the House of Lords, in case the House of Commons had passed the same draft \\nthrice in a minimum span of two years. It must be noted that the Indian adaptation \\nunder Article 109 and 110 do not have exceptions for ‘public bills’ nor do they \\nexplicitly provide that such certification shall not be amenable to judicial review \\nunlike in the Parliament Act of 1911. \\n97.  The Constitution of India by Article 110(4), requires that every ‘money bill’ \\nbe certified to be so by the Speaker before it is transmitted to the Rajya Sabha for \\n44their non-binding consideration. The Speaker of the Lok Sabha hence is the only \\nappropriate authority to decide the nature of a bill under Article 110(3).  \\n98.  In the present dispute, the Union has relied upon the finality accorded to \\nsuch certification by the terminology of Article 110(3) which provides that in case \\nof any dispute as to the nature of a bill, “the decision of the Speaker of the House \\nof the People thereon shall be final.” The Lok Sabha Speaker, in fact, on a dispute \\nhaving so arisen has adjudicated the then Finance Bill, 2017 to be a ‘money bill’. \\nFurther, the Union also places emphasis on Article 122(1) of the Constitution which \\nprovides that: \\n“122. (1) The validity of any proceedings in Parliament all not be called in question \\non the ground of any alleged irregularity of procedure.” \\n99.  The Union thus, alternatively, contends that the challenge before this Court \\nto the certification of the Speaker of the Finance Bill, 2017 as a ‘money bill’ and its \\nconsequent passage without the assent of the Rajya Sabha would at best amount \\nto an ‘irregularity of procedure’ of ‘proceedings in Parliament’ and hence cannot be \\ninquired into by this Court.  \\n100.  It must be noted once again, that like Articles 109 and 110, Article 122 of \\nour Constitution too can be traced to the Constitutional history and developments \\nin the United Kingdom.  Certain Members of Parliament were tried and imprisoned \\nfor their remarks in Parliament during the seventeenth century resulting in the \\nenactment  of  Article  9  of  the  Bill  of  Rights,  1688  which  specifies  that  “…. \\nproceedings  in  Parliament  ought  not  to  be  impeached  or  questioned  in  any \\nCourt….” Article 212(1) of the Constitution of India provides a direct corollary of \\nArticle 122(1) with respect to State legislatures. \\n45101.  This  provision  was  initially  interpreted  in  MSM  Sharma  vs.  Dr.  Shree \\nKrishna Sinha20 to mean that legislative business cannot be invalidated even if it \\nis not strictly in compliance with law for such issues were within the “special \\njurisdiction” of the legislature to regulate its own business. \\n102.  The Union’s contention that Article 122 would exempt from judicial scrutiny \\npassage of bills is a far-fetched contention.  If such a blanket exemption were to \\nbe granted, then it would open the floodgates to deviation from any Constitutional \\nprovision governing the functioning of Parliament and its legislative procedure.  \\nSince the Constitution explicitly provides a self-contained detailed procedure for \\nenactment of legislation, and does not suggest that mere assent of the President \\nto a law, by whatsoever method adopted, would become a valid law, it is necessary \\nthat this Court being the highest Constitutional forum for judicial review is provided \\nwith enough space for enforcement and protection of the Constitutional scheme.  \\nA perusal of the expressions used in Article 122 and a comparison with its British \\nroots make it clear that the “proceedings” referred to include the power of the \\nParliament to frame its own rules, set out procedures for debate and discussion \\nand powers to enforce disciple.  Section 3 of the Parliament Act, 1911 in the United \\nKingdom makes the decision of the Speaker of the House of Commons ‘conclusive \\nfor all purposes’ and ‘shall not be questioned in any court of law’. The Constitution \\nof India however, under Article 110(3), states that ‘if any question arises whether \\na Bill is a Money Bill or not, the decision of the Speaker of the House of the People \\nthereon shall be final’. A different syntax seems to indicate that our Constitution \\n \\n20 AIR 1959 SC 395. \\n46makes the decision of the Speaker as to the nature of Bill final qua members of \\nboth the Houses of Parliament, though it is not conclusive and unchallengeable \\nbefore the Courts. The scope of judicial review of decisions that enjoy the status of \\nfinality  under  the  Constitution  has  been  examined  by  this  Court  on  several \\noccasions.  We would like to refer to a few precedents in this regard.  In Raja Ram \\nPal v. Lok Sabha21, this Court had examined the ambit and scope of judicial review \\nin  matters  of  Parliamentary  privileges  and  powers  under  Article  105  of  the \\nConstitution. The Court had held that under Article 122(1) and 212(1), immunity \\nthat has been granted is limited to ‘irregularity of procedure’ and does not extend \\nto substantive illegality or unconstitutionality by observing: \\n“Any attempt to read a limitation into Article 122 so as to restrict the court\\'s \\njurisdiction  to  examination  of  the  Parliament\\'s  procedure  in  case  of \\nunconstitutionality, as opposed to illegality would amount to doing violence to \\nthe constitutional text. Applying the principle of \"expressio unius est exclusio \\nalterius\" (whatever has not been included has by implication been excluded), \\nit is plain and clear that prohibition against examination on the touchstone of \\n\"irregularity of procedure\" does not make taboo judicial review on findings of \\nillegality or unconstitutionality.” \\n \\nIn Union of India v. Jyoti Prakash Mitter22, this Court had examined clause \\n(3) to Article 217 which makes the decision of the President after consultation with \\nthe Chief Justice of India ‘final’, if the question arises as to the age of a Judge of a \\nHigh Court. It was observed that notwithstanding the declared finality of the order \\nof the President, the Court can, in appropriate cases when the order has been \\npassed on collateral considerations or the rules of natural justice are not observed \\nor when the judgment of the President is coloured by the advice or representation \\nmade by the Executive or is made with no evidence, set aside the order of the \\n \\n21 (2007) 3 SCC 184 \\n22 (1971) 1 SCC 396 \\n47President made under Article 217(3). The Courts, however, do not sit in appeal \\nover the judgment of the President or decide the weight to be attached to the \\nevidence which is entirely within the domain of the President.  \\nReading of the above decisions exposit that ‘finality’ of decisions under the \\nConstitution  has  been  subject  to  judicial  review  by  the  Courts.  However,  the \\njurisdiction exercisable by the Courts in such matters is rather limited and is subject \\nto the satisfaction of specific conditions as discussed. We find no good ground and \\nreason to take a different view with respect to the power of judicial review against \\ncertification of a bill as a Money Bill by the Speaker under Article 110(4). Article \\n110(3) which makes this decision final qua both the Houses of Parliament and \\nArticle 122(1) which prohibits review by the courts in matters of ‘irregularity of \\nprocedure’ cannot operate as a bar when a challenge is made on the ground of \\nillegality or unconstitutionality under the Constitutional scheme. \\n103.  Determining  whether  an  impugned  action  or  breach  is  an  exempted \\nirregularity or a justiciable illegality is a matter of judicial interpretation and would \\nundoubtedly fall within the ambit of Courts and cannot be left to the sole authority \\nof the Parliament to decide. Such a position has also been taken in the United \\nKingdom by the House of Lords in R (Jackson) vs. Attorney General23 where \\nnotwithstanding  the  explicit  bar  to  judicial  consideration  of  all  Parliamentary \\nproceedings (and not just procedural irregularities as under the Constitution of \\nIndia), the Court assumed jurisdiction whilst noting that interpretation of statutes \\ndealing with legislative processes would fall within the domain of the Courts; \\n \\n23 [2005] UKHL 56. \\n48statutory  interpretation  being  a  judicial  exercise,  regardless  of  the  immunities \\ngranted to parliamentary proceedings under the Bill of Rights. \\n104.  It would hence be gainsaid that gross violations of the Constitutional scheme \\nwould not be mere procedural irregularities and hence would be outside the limited \\nambit of immunity from judicial scrutiny under Article 122(1). In the case at hand, \\njurisdiction of this Court is, hence, not barred.  \\n105.  On the substantive question of whether the Finance Act, 2017 was a ‘money \\nbill’ under Article 110(3) it must be noted that until the turn of the twenty-first \\ncentury, this Court took a consistent position that Article 110(3) of the Constitution \\nwould act as an express bar against judicial inquiry into the correctness of the \\ncertificate of ‘money bill’ given by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha.  \\n106.  In Mohd. Saeed Siddiqui vs. State of Uttar Pradesh24, a three-judge \\nbench refused to judicially review the speaker’s certification of the Uttar Pradesh \\nLokayukta and Up-Lokayuktas (Amendment) Bill as a Money bill. The phrase \\n“proceedings of the Legislature” under Article 212(1) was interpreted to include \\n“everything said or done in either house”. This Court thus held: \\n“43. As discussed above, the decision of the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly \\nthat the Bill in question was a Money Bill is final and the said decision cannot be \\ndisputed nor can the procedure of the State Legislature be questioned by virtue of \\nArticle  212.  Further,  as  noted  earlier,  Article  255  also  shows  that  under  the \\nConstitution the matters of procedure do not render invalid an Act to which assent \\nhas been given to by the President or the Governor, as the case may be. Inasmuch \\nas the Bill in question was a Money Bill, the contrary contention by the Petitioner \\nagainst  the  passing  of  the  said  Bill  by  the  Legislative  Assembly  alone  is \\nunacceptable.” \\n \\n24 (2014) 11 SCC 415. \\n49107.  This was relied upon in Yogendra Kumar Jaiswal vs. State of Bihar25, \\nwherein a division bench of this Court refused to judicially review the certification \\nof ‘money bill’ accorded by the Speaker to the Orissa Special Courts Bill noting that \\nit was settled post Mohd. Siddiqui (supra) that any such certification would be an \\n“irregularity” and not a “substantiality”.  \\n108.  A co-ordinate bench of this Court in Justice Puttaswamy (Retd.) and Anr. \\nv. Union of India26, was tasked with a similar question of the certification of ‘money \\nbill’ accorded to the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, \\nBenefits and Services) Act, 2016 by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha. The majority \\nopinion after noting the important role of the Rajya Sabha in a bicameral legislative \\nsetup,  observed  that  Article  110  being  an  exceptional  provision,  must  be \\ninterpreted narrowly. Although the majority opinion did not examine the correctness \\nof the decisions in Md. Siddiqui (supra) and Yogendra Kumar Jaiswal (supra) \\nor conclusively pronounce on the scope of jurisdiction or power of this Court to \\njudicially  review  certification  by  the  Speaker  under  Article  110(3),  yet,  it \\nindependently reached a conclusion that the impugned enactment fell within the \\nfour-corners of Articles 110(1) and hence was a ‘money bill’. The minority view \\nrendered, however, explicitly overruled both Md. Siddiqui (supra) and Yogendra \\nKumar Jaiswal (supra). \\n109.  The majority opinion in Puttaswamy (supra) by examining whether or not \\nthe impugned enactment was in fact a ‘money bill’ under Article 110 without \\nexplicitly dealing with whether or not certification of the speaker is subject to judicial \\n \\n25  (2016) 3 SCC 183 \\n26 (2019) 1 SCC 1. \\n50review, has kept intact the power of judicial review under Article 110(3). It was \\nfurther held therein that the expression ‘money bill’ cannot be construed in a \\nrestrictive sense and that the wisdom of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha in this regard \\nmust  be  valued,  save  where  it  is  blatantly  violative  of  the  scheme  of  the \\nConstitution. We respectfully endorse the view in Puttaswamy (supra) and are in \\nno doubt that Md. Siddiqui and Yogendra Kumar Jaiswal in so far as they put \\ndecisions of the Speaker under Article 110(3) beyond judicial review, cannot be \\nrelied upon.   \\n110.  It must be emphasized that the scope of judicial review in matters under \\nArticle 110(3) is extremely restricted, with there being a need to maintain judicial \\ndeference to the Lok Sabha Speaker’s certification. There would be a presumption \\nof legality in favour of the Speaker’s decision and onus would undoubtedly be on \\nthe person challenging its validity to show that such certification was grossly \\nunconstitutional or tainted with blatant substantial illegality. Courts ought not to \\nreplace  the  Speaker’s  assessment  or  take  a  second  plausible  interpretation. \\nInstead, judicial review must be restricted to only the very extreme instance where \\nthere is a complete disregard to the Constitutional scheme itself. It is not the \\nfunction of Constitutional Courts to act as appellate forums, especially on the \\nopinion  of  the  Speaker,  for  doing  so  would  invite  the  risk  of  paralyzing  the \\nfunctioning of the Parliament. \\n111.  In light of the aforementioned narrow scope of inquiry and the high burden \\nto be discharged by the petitioner(s) against the Speaker’s certification, we may \\nnow examine the challenge laid to the Finance Act, 2017.  \\n51112.  Provisions of Part XIV can be broken down into three broad categories.  \\nFirst,  abolition  and  merger  of  existing  Tribunals;  second,  uniformizing  and \\ndelegating to the Central Government through the Rules the power to lay down \\nqualifications; method of appointment and removal, and terms and conditions of \\nservice of Presiding Officers and members; and third, termination of services and \\npayment of compensation to presiding officers and members of certain tribunals \\nthat have now become de-funct. \\n113.  Interpretation of Article 110 was made by a coordinate Constitution Bench \\nin K.S. Puttaswamy (Aadhaar-5) and is relied upon by both sides. \\n114.  The majority judgment in K.S. Puttaswamy (Aadhaar-5) under the heading \\n‘Money Bill’, in paragraph 448 and then in paragraphs 452 to 461, had recorded \\nthe submissions made by the learned counsel, including the submission made on \\nbehalf of the petitioners relying upon the word ‘only’ appearing in Article 110 which \\ndefines a ‘Money Bill’.  With regard to the interpretation to be given to the meaning \\nof the word ‘only’, reliance was placed on Hari Ram v. Babu Gopal Prasad27 and \\nM/s Saru Smelting (P) Ltd. v. Commissioner of Sales Tax, Lucknow28.  The \\nmajority  judgment  had  thereupon  referred  to  the  power  of  judicial  review \\nnotwithstanding the use of the word ‘final’ with reference to the power of the \\nSpeaker under Article 110(3) of the Constitution, an aspect which we have already \\nanswered earlier, and examined Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act to observe “it is also \\naccepted  by  the  petitioners  that  Section  7  is  the  main  provision  of  the  Act”.  \\nThereafter, reference was made to the other provisions of the Aadhaar Act to \\n \\n27 (1991) Supp. 2 SCC 608 \\n28 (1993) Supp. 3 SCC 97 \\n52record the majority opinion that the bill in question was rightly introduced as a \\n“Money Bill”.  The majority judgment, therefore, did not elucidate and explain the \\nscope  and  ambit  of sub-clauses  (a)  to (f)  to  clause  (1)  of  Article  110  of  the \\nConstitution, a legal position and facet which arises for consideration in the present \\ncase and assumes considerable importance. \\n115.  Ashok  Bhushan,  J.,  in  his  concurring  judgment,  from  paragraph  886 \\nonwards, had examined the issue of “Money Bill” and its justiciability and as noticed \\nabove, overruled Mohd. Saeed Siddiqui (supra) and Yogesh (supra) as not laying \\ndown the correct law by relying upon the decisions of this Court in Kihoto Hollohan \\nv. Zachillhu and Others29 and Raja Ram Pal (supra). Referring to the definition \\nof “Money Bill” and the meaning and purpose of the word ‘only’ used in Article \\n110(1) of the Constitution, Ashok Bhushan, J. had observed that legislative intent \\nwas that the main and substantive provision of an enactment should only be any \\nor all of the sub-clauses from (a) to (f).  In the event the main or substantive \\nprovisions of the Act are not covered by sub-clauses (a) to (f), the bill cannot be \\nsaid to be a “Money Bill” {See paragraph 905}.  It was further observed that the use \\nof the word ‘only’ in Article 110(1) has its purpose, which is clear restriction for a \\nbill to be certified as a “Money Bill” {See paragraph 906}.  Referring to the Aadhaar \\nAct, it was observed that it veers around the government’s constitutional obligation \\nto provide for subsidies, benefits and services to individuals and other provisions \\nare only incidental provisions to the main provision.  Therefore, the Aadhaar Bill \\nwas rightly certified by the Speaker as a “Money Bill”. \\n \\n29 (1992) Supp. 2 SCC 651 \\n53116.  Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud, J., in his minority opinion on the said question, \\nreferring to the word ‘only’ in Article 110(1) of the Constitution had observed that \\nthe pith and substance doctrine which is applicable to legislative entries would not \\napply when deciding the question whether or not a particular bill is a “Money Bill”.  \\nReferring to sub-clause (e) of Article 110(1), it was held that the Money Bill must \\ndeal with the declaration of any expenditure to be charged on the Consolidated \\nFund of India (or increasing the amount of expenditure) and, therefore, Section 7 \\nof the Aadhaar Act did not have the effect of making the bill a Money Bill as it did  \\nnot declare the expenditure incurred on services, benefits or subsidies to be a \\ncharge on the Consolidated Fund of India.  Section 7 mandates Aadhaar for \\navailing  services,  benefits  or  subsidies  which  were  already  charged  to  the \\nConsolidated Fund of India.  However, this view was not accepted by the majority \\njudgment. \\n117.  In the context of Article 110(1) of the Constitution, use of the word ‘only’ in \\nrelation to sub-clauses (a) to (f) pose an interesting, albeit a difficult question which \\nwas not examined and answered by the majority judgment in K.S. Puttaswamy \\n(Aadhaar-5).  While it may be easier to decipher a bill relating to imposition, \\nabolition, remission, alteration or regulation of any tax, difficulties would arise in the \\ninterpretation of Article 110(1) specifically with reference to sub-clauses (b) to (f) in \\na bill relating to borrowing of money or giving of any guarantee by the Government \\nof India, or an amendment of law concerning financial obligation. In the book, \\n“Practices and Procedures of Parliament” by Kaul and Shakdher, it is opined that \\nunless the word ‘only’ is interpreted in a right manner, Article 110(1) would be a \\nnullity. A liberal and wide interpretation, on the other hand, possibly exposits an \\n54opposite consequence.  Relevant portion of the opinion by Kaul and Shakdher \\nreads: \\n“Speaker Mavalankar observed as follows: “Prima facie, it appears to me that \\nthe words of article 110 (imposition, abolition, remission, alteration, regulation \\nof any tax) are sufficiently wide to make the Consolidated Bill a Money Bill. A \\nquestion may arise as to what is the exact significance or scope of the word \\n‘only’ and whether and how far that word goes to modify or control the wide \\nand general words ‘imposition, abolition, remission, etc.’. I think, prima facie, \\nthat the word ‘only’ is not restrictive of the scope of the general terms. If a Bill \\nsubstantially deals with the imposition, abolition, etc., of a tax, then the mere \\nfact of the inclusion in the Bill of other provisions which may be necessary for \\nthe administration of that tax or, I may say, necessary for the achievement of \\nthe objective of the particular Bill, cannot take away the Bill from the category \\nof Money Bills. One has to look to the objective of the bill. Therefore, if the \\nsubstantial provisions of the Bill aim at imposition, abolition, etc., of any tax \\nthen the other provisions would be incidental and their inclusion cannot be \\nsaid to take it away from the category of a Money Bill. Unless one construes \\nthe word ‘only’ in this way it might lead to make article 110 a nullity. No tax \\ncan be imposed without making provisions for its assessment, collection, \\nadministration, reference to courts or tribunals, etc, one can visualise only one \\nsection in a Bill imposing the main tax and there may be fifty other sections \\nwhich may deal with the scope, method, manner, etc., of that imposition. \\nFurther, we have also to consider the provisions of sub-clause (2) of article \\n110; and these provisions may be helpful to clarify the scope of the word ‘only’, \\nnot directly but indirectly.” \\n \\n118.  The majority judgment did not advert to the doctrine of pith and substance \\nwhereas judgment of Ashok Bhushan, J. had referred to the dominant purpose.  \\nThe test of dominant purpose possibly has its own limitation as many a legislation \\nwould have more than one dominant objective especially when this prescription is \\nread with reference to sub-clauses (a) to (f) of Article 110(1) of the Constitution.  \\nFurther, determination of what constitutes paramount and cardinal purpose of the \\nlegislation and the test applicable to determine this compunction and incertitude \\nitself is not free from ambiguity.  Difficulties would arise with reference to sub-\\nclauses (b), (c), (d) and (e) of Article 110(1), when we apply the principles of \\ndominant or the main purpose of an enactment test. Sub-clause (c) to Article 110(1) \\nrefers to payment of monies into or withdrawal of monies from the Consolidated \\n55Fund  of  India.  Sub-clause  (d)  refers  to  appropriation  of  monies  out  of  the \\nConsolidated Fund of India.  Sub-clause (e) refers to declaration of any expenditure \\ncharged on the Consolidated Fund of India or increasing of the amount of such \\nexpenditure.  Sub-clause (f) relates to receipt of money on account of Consolidated \\nFund of India or Public Account of India or issue of such money or the audit of the \\naccounts of the Union or of State.  Even clause (b) in its amplitude includes an \\namendment of the law in respect of a financial obligation undertaken or to be \\nundertaken by the Government of India.  Once we hold that the decision of the \\nSpeaker under clause (3) of Article 110 of the Constitution though final, is subject \\nto judicial scrutiny on the principle of constitutional illegality, the provisions of Article \\n110(1) have to be given an appropriate meaning and interpretation to avoid and \\nprevent over-inclusiveness or under-inclusiveness. Any interpretation would have \\nfar reaching consequences. It is therefore, necessary that there should be absolute \\nclarity with regard to the provisions and any ambiguity and debate should be ironed \\nout and affirmatively decided.  In case of doubt, certainly the opinion of the Speaker \\nwould be conclusive, but that would not be a consideration to avoid answering and \\ndeciding  the  scope  and  ambit  of  “Money  Bill”  under  Article  110(1)  of  the \\nConstitution.  For example, taxation enactments like the Income Tax Act would \\nqualify as Money Bill under sub-clause (a) to clause (1) of Article 110 and may \\ninclude provisions relating to Appellate Tribunals which would possibly qualify as \\nincidental provisions covered under sub-clause (g) to clause (1) of Article 110, even \\nif we exclude application of sub-clause (d) to clause (1) of Article 110.  The position \\nit could be argued would be different with reference to provisions for constitution of \\na tribunal under the Administrative Tribunal Act or the National Green Tribunal Act. \\n56The  bill  could  however  state  that  the  expenditure  would  be  charged  on  the \\nConsolidated Fund of India.  \\n119.  Another aspect which would arise for consideration would be the legal \\nconsequences in case a Non-Money Bill certified by the Speaker as a Money Bill, \\nwhen presented before the Rajya Sabha is specifically objected to on this count by \\nsome Members, but on being put to vote no recommendations are made in respect \\nof “Non-Money” Bill related provisions. \\n120.  The petitioners had argued on the strength of the concurring opinion by \\nAshok Bhushan, J. holding that in addition to at least one provision falling under \\nArticle 110(1) (a) to (f), each of the other remaining provisions must also be \\nincidental to such core provision(s), and hence must satisfy the requirement of \\nArticle 110(g).  Such an interpretation, it was contended, would make the insertion \\nof the word ‘only’ under the prefatory part of Article 110(1) purposeful, which was \\nsaid to have been glossed over by the Union.  Further, it was contended that the \\nmanner in which the majority correlated Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act to Article \\n110(1)(e) was erroneous, for it only regulated procedure for withdrawal by imposing \\na requirement for authentication and did not declare any expenditure to be a charge \\non the Consolidated Fund of India.  They had contended that the interpretation of \\nthe enactment by the majority judgement was constitutionally inexact and that a \\nsimilar  analysis  ought  not  to  be  made  in  the  present  case.    The  petitioners, \\ntherefore, contend that every impugned provision be individually examined and \\nbrought either under Article 110(1)(a) to (f) or be incidental thereto, as permitted \\nby Article 110(g).  In case even a single provision did not satisfy either of the \\naforementioned two categories, then the entire Finance Act, 2017 would be an \\n57affront to the prefatory phraseology of Article 110(1) and must be declared as being \\nunconstitutional. \\n \\n121.  However,  the  learned  Attorney  General  has  propounded  that \\nconstitutionality of the Finance Act, 2017 would be safe if its dominant provisions, \\nwhich form the core of the enactment, fall within the ambit of Article 110(1)(a) to \\n(f).  Other minor provisions, even if not strictly incidental, could take the dominant \\ncolour and could be passed along with it as a Money Bill. As per such interpretation, \\nprovisions ought not to be read in a piece-meal manner, and judicial review ought \\nto be applied deferentially.   \\n \\n122.  Upon an extensive examination of the matter, we notice that the majority in \\nK.S. Puttaswamy (Aadhaar-5) pronounced the nature of the impugned enactment \\nwithout first delineating the scope of Article 110(1) and principles for interpretation \\nor the repercussions of such process.  It is clear to us that the majority dictum in \\nK.S. Puttaswamy (Aadhaar-5) did not substantially discuss the effect of the word \\n‘only’ in Article 110(1) and offers little guidance on the repercussions of a finding \\nwhen some of the provisions of an enactment passed as a “Money Bill” do not \\nconform to Article 110(1)(a) to (g).  Its interpretation of the provisions of the \\nAadhaar Act was arguably liberal and the Court’s satisfaction of the said provisions \\nbeing incidental to Article 110(1)(a) to (f), it has been argued is not convincingly \\nreasoned, as might not be in accord with the bicameral Parliamentary system \\nenvisaged under our constitutional scheme.  Without expressing a firm and final \\nopinion, it has to be observed that the analysis in K.S. Puttaswamy (Aadhaar-5) \\n58makes its application difficult to the present case and raises a potential conflict \\nbetween the judgements of coordinate Benches. \\n \\n123.  Given the various challenges made to the scope of judicial review and \\ninterpretative principles (or lack thereof) as adumbrated by the majority in K.S. \\nPuttaswamy (Aadhaar-5) and the substantial precedential impact of its analysis of \\nthe Aadhaar Act, 2016, it becomes essential to determine its correctness.  Being a \\nBench of equal strength as that in K.S. Puttaswamy (Aadhaar-5), we accordingly \\ndirect that this batch of matters be placed before Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India, \\non the administrative side, for consideration by a larger Bench. \\n \\n124.  There is yet another reason why we feel the matter should be referred to a \\nConstitution Bench of seven judges.  L. Chandra Kumar (supra), which was \\ndecided  by  a  Bench  of  seven  Judges,  had  also  interpreted  on  the  ambit  of \\nsupervision by the High Courts under Article 227(1) of the Constitution to observe \\nthat the Constitutional scheme does not require all adjudicatory bodies which fall \\nwithin  the  territorial  jurisdiction  of  the  High  Courts  should  be  subject  to  their \\nsupervisory jurisdiction, as the idea is to divest the High Courts of their onerous \\nburden. Consequently, adding to their supervisory functions vide Article 227(1) \\ncannot be of assistance in any manner.  Thereafter, it was observed that different \\ntribunals constituted under different enactments are administered by the Central \\nand the State Governments, yet there was no uniformity in administration.  This \\nCourt was of the view that until a wholly independent agency for such tribunals can \\nbe set up, it is desirable that all such tribunals should be, as far as possible, under \\n59a single nodal Ministry which will be in a position to oversee the working of these \\ntribunals.  For a number of reasons, the Court observed that the Ministry of Law \\nwould be the appropriate ministry.  The Ministry of Law in turn was required to \\nappoint an independent supervisory body to oversee the working of the Tribunals.  \\nAs noticed above, this has not happened.  In these circumstances, it would be \\nappropriate if these aspects and questions are looked into by a Bench of seven \\nJudges. \\n \\nISSUE II:  WHETHER  SECTION  184  OF  THE  FINANCE  ACT,  2017  IS \\nUNCONSTITUTIONAL  ON  ACCOUNT  OF  EXCESSIVE \\nDELEGATION? \\n \\n \\n125.  The  second  challenge  against  Part  XIV  of  the  Finance  Act,  2017  is \\npredicated on the assertion that this is a case of excessive delegation as it falters \\non the anvil of “essential legislative functions” and “policy and guidelines” tests. \\n \\n126.  The Eighth Schedule referred to in Section 183 contains a list of 19 tribunals \\nwith corresponding enactments under which they were constituted.  Section 183 \\noverrides the provisions of the enactments specified in column (3) of the Eighth \\nSchedule and mandates that from the appointed date, the Chairperson, Vice-\\nChairperson,  Chairman,  Vice  Chairman,  President,  Vice-President,  Presiding \\nOfficer or Member of the Tribunal, Appellate Tribunal  or, as the case may be, other \\nAuthorities as specified in column (2) of the Eighth Schedule shall be appointed in \\nterms of provisions of Section 184 of the Finance Act.  These provisions however, \\n60do  not  apply  to  those  who  have  already  been  appointed  to  the  said  posts \\nimmediately before the appointed date, that is the date on which the Central \\nGovernment may, by a notification in the Official Gazette, bring the said provisions \\ninto effect.   \\n127.  Section 184, to repeat, reads as under:       \\n“184. Qualifications, appointment, term and conditions of service, \\nsalary and allowances, etc., of Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson \\nand Members, etc., of the Tribunal, Appellate Tribunal and other \\nAuthorities.—(1) The Central Government may, by notification, make \\nrules to provide for qualifications, appointment, term of office, salaries \\nand  allowances,  resignation,  removal  and  the  other  terms  and \\nconditions of service of the Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson, Chairman, \\nVice-Chairman,  President,  Vice-President,  Presiding  Officer  or \\nMember of the Tribunal, Appellate Tribunal or, as the case may be, \\nother Authorities as specified in column (2) of the Eighth Schedule:  \\n \\nProvided that the Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson, Chairman, \\nVice-Chairman,  President,  Vice-President,  Presiding  Officer  or \\nMember of the Tribunal, Appellate Tribunal or other Authority shall hold \\noffice for such term as specified in the rules made by the Central \\nGovernment but not exceeding five years from the date on which he \\nenters upon his office and shall be eligible for reappointment:  \\n \\nProvided  further  that  no  Chairperson,  Vice-Chairperson, \\nChairman,  Vice-Chairman,  President,  Vice-President,  Presiding \\nOfficer or Member shall hold office as such after he has attained such \\nage as specified in the rules made by the Central Government which \\nshall not exceed,—  \\n(a)  in the case of Chairperson, Chairman or President, the age of \\nseventy years;  \\n(b)  in  the  case  of  Vice-Chairperson,  Vice-Chairman,  Vice-\\nPresident, Presiding Officer or any other Member, the age of \\nsixty-seven years:  \\n \\n(2)  Neither  the  salary  and  allowances  nor  the  other  terms  and \\nconditions of service of Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson, Chairman, \\nVice-Chairman,  President,  Vice-President,  Presiding  Officer  or \\nMember of the Tribunal, Appellate Tribunal or, as the case may be, \\nother  Authority  may  be  varied  to  his  disadvantage  after  his \\nappointment.” \\n \\n  Section 184 has conferred upon the Central Government power to \\nmake  rules  by  way  of  notification  to  provide  for  (a)  qualifications;  (b) \\nappointment; (c) term of office; (d) salaries and allowances; (e) resignation; \\nand  (f)  removal  and  other  terms  and  conditions  of  service  of  the \\n61Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson, Chairman, Vice-Chairman, President, Vice-\\nPresident, Presiding Officer or Member of the Tribunal, Appellate Tribunal \\nor, as the case may be, other Authorities as specified in column (2) of the \\nEighth Schedule.  The first proviso states that the incumbent officers shall \\nhold office for such terms as may be specified in the rules made by the \\nCentral Government but the term shall not exceed five years from the date \\non which he assumes the office and shall be eligible for reappointment. The \\nsecond proviso states that the persons so appointed shall hold office till they \\nattain the age specified in the rules made by the Central Government which \\nshall not exceed in the case of Chairperson, Chairman and the President, \\nthe age of 70 years and in the case of Vice-Chairperson, Vice-Chairman, \\nVice-President or any other Members, the age of 67 years.  Sub-section 2 \\nto Section 184 states that the salaries and allowances and other terms and \\nconditions of service of the persons appointed may not be varied to their \\ndisadvantage after appointment.   \\n128.  Section 185 (1) of the Finance Act is also relevant and reads: \\n“185.  Transitional  provisions.—  (1)  Any  person  appointed  as  the \\nChairperson or Chairman, President or Vice-Chairperson or Vice-Chairman, \\nVice-President or Presiding Officer or Member of the Tribunals, Appellate \\nTribunals, or as the case may be, other Authorities specified in column (2) of \\nthe  Ninth  Schedule  and  holding  office  as  such  immediately  before  the \\nappointed day, shall on and from the appointed day, cease to hold such office \\nand such Chairperson or Chairman, President, Vice-Chairperson or Vice-\\nChairman, Vice-President or Presiding officer or Member shall be entitled to \\nclaim compensation not exceeding three months\\' pay and allowances for the \\npremature termination of term of their office or of any contract of service.” \\n \\nThe  Chairperson  or  Chairman,  President  or  Vice-Chairperson  or  Vice-\\nChairman,  Vice-President  or  Presiding  Officer  or  Member  of  the \\nTribunals/Appellate Tribunals specified in column (2) of the Ninth Schedule who \\n62hold office as per the above provisions before the appointed date shall cease to do \\nso and will be entitled to compensation not exceeding three months’ pay and \\nallowance for the premature termination of the office or the contract of office.  \\nHowever, we would clarify that presently we are not examining constitutional vires \\nof sub-section (1) to Section 185. \\n129.  Section 186 of the Finance Act, 2017 reads as under: \\n“186. General Power to make rules.— Without prejudice to any other power to \\nmake rules contained elsewhere in this Part, the Central Government may, by \\nnotification, make rules generally to carry out the provisions of this Part.” \\n \\nThe aforesaid provisions stipulate that without prejudice to any other power \\nto make rules contained elsewhere in the Part XIV of the Finance Act, 2017, the \\nCentral Government may, by notification, makes rules generally to carry out the \\nprovisions of the said Part.   \\n130.  Reading of the said provisions indicates that except for providing the upper \\nage limit and that the person appointed shall not have tenure exceeding five years \\nfrom the date on which he enters office and shall be eligible for re-appointment, \\nthe Finance  Act  delegates  the power to specify the qualifications,  method of \\nselection  and  appointment,  terms  of  office,  salaries  and  allowances,  removal \\nincluding resignation and all other terms and conditions of service to the Central \\nGovernment which would act as a delegatee of the Parliament.  The governing \\nstatutory provisions embodied in the existing parent legislation specified in the \\ncolumn (3) of the Schedule and the rules made thereunder are overwritten and \\nauthority  and  power  is  conferred  on  the  Central  Government  to  decide \\nqualifications for appointment, process for selection, and terms and conditions of \\nservice including salaries allowance, resignation and removal through delegated \\n63or  subordinate  legislation.  Before  we  look  into  the  vires  of  this  delegation,  it \\nbehoves us to recount and reflect on the approach adopted by this Court in gauging \\nthe validity of delegated legislation.    \\n131.  This Court addressed this conundrum the first time in In re: The Delhi Laws \\nAct,30 wherein a seven-Judge Bench delivered seven different judgements clearly \\nevincing the divergence of opinion on the issue. Albeit, the majority view, as \\nclarified and held by J. M. Shelat, J. speaking for the majority in B. Shama Rao v. \\nUnion Territory of Pondicherry,31 can be deduced as under: \\n“In view of the intense divergence of opinion except for their conclusion \\npartially to uphold the validity of the said laws it is difficult to deduce \\nany general principle which on the principle of state decision can be \\ntaken as binding in for future cases. It is trite to say that a decision is \\nbinding not because of its conclusion but in regard to its ratio and the \\nprinciple laid down therein. The utmost therefore that can be said of \\nthis decision is that the minimum on which there appears to be \\nconsensus was (1) that legislatures in India both before and after the \\nConstitution had plenary power within their respective fields; (2) that \\nthey were never the delegates of the British Parliament; (3) that they \\nhad power to delegate within certain limits not by reason of such a \\npower being inherent in the legislative power but because such power \\nis recognised even in the United States of America were separatist \\nideology prevails on the ground that it is necessary to effectively \\nexercise the legislative power in a modem state with multifarious \\nactivities  and  complex  problems  facing  legislatures  and  (4)  that \\ndelegation  of  an  essential,  legislative  function  which  amounts  to \\nabdication even partial is not permissible. All of them were agreed that \\nit could be in respect of subsidiary and ancillary power.” \\n \\n \\nAll  the  seven  Judges  were  in  unison  that  abdication  or  effacement  by \\nconferring the power of legislation to the subordinate authority even if partial is not \\npermissible. The difference of opinion primarily arose from the meaning and scope \\nof the abdication or effacement of the legislative power. On the said aspect, we \\nwould like to refer to the judgments of Fazl Ali, J, Mukherjea, J and Bose, J. Fazl \\nAli, J. had expressed the said principle as :  \\n \\n30 1951 AIR 332 \\n31 (2015) 4 SCC 770 \\n64“The true distinction ..... is this. The legislature cannot delegate the \\npower to make a law; but it can make a law to delegate a power to \\ndetermine some fact or state of things upon which the law makes, or \\nintends to make, its own action depend. To deny this would be to stop \\nthe wheels of Government. \\n \\n2. The true import of the rule against delegation is this: \\n\"This rule in a broad sense involves the principle underlying the maxim, \\ndelegatus non potest delegate, but it is apt to be misunderstood and \\nhas been misunderstood. In my judgment, all that it means is that the \\nlegislature cannot abdicate its legislative functions and it cannot efface \\nitself and set up a parallel legislature to discharge the primary duty with \\nwhich it has been entrusted. This rule has been recognised both in \\nAmerica and in England ......              \\n      \\n                       xx           xx            xx  \\n \\nWhat constitutes abdication and what class of cases will be covered \\nby that expression will always be a question of fact, and it is by no \\nmeans easy to lay down any comprehensive formula to define it, but it \\nshould be recognised that the rule against abdication does not prohibit \\nthe Legislature from employing any subordinate agency of its own \\nchoice for doing such subsidiary acts as may be necessary to make its \\nlegislation effective, useful and complete.” \\n \\nThe  learned  Judge  had  further  observed  that  an  act  is  a  law  when  it \\nembodies policies, defines standards and directs the authority chosen to act within \\ncertain prescribed limits and not go beyond.  The Act should be a complete \\nexpression of the will of the Legislature to act in a particular way and of its \\ncommand on how it should be carried out. When the Legislature decides the \\ncircumstances as the best way to legislate on a subject, then, such legislation does \\nnot amount to abdication of powers because from the very nature to legislation it \\nis manifest that when power is misused it can be withdrawn, altered and repealed. \\nMost importantly, the delegate is to only adopt and extend the laws enacted by the \\nLegislature.   \\n132.  Mukherjea, J. opined that the legislative functions concern with declaring the \\nlegislative policy and laying down the standards which is to be enacted into a rule \\nof law, and what can be delegated as the task of subordinate legislation by its very \\nnature is ancillary to the statute which delegates the power to make it. When the \\n65legislative policy is enunciated with sufficient clearness or the standards are laid \\ndown, the Courts cannot interfere with the discretion that the Legislature has \\nexercised in determining the extent of necessary delegation.  The delegatee cannot \\nbe allowed to check the policy declared by the legislators and cannot be given the \\npower to repeal or abrogate any statute. \\n133.  Bose,  J.  while  observing  that  the main  function of  the legislature  is to \\nlegislate and not leave it to others, nevertheless acknowledged that it is impossible \\nto  carry  on  government  of  a  modern  State  with  its  infinite  complexities  and \\nramifications without a large devolution of power and delegation of authority. This \\nis a practical necessity which has been acknowledged even by the American \\nCourts. To decide otherwise would make it difficult for the government to function \\nand work effectively.    \\n134.  A Division Bench of this Court in Ramesh Birch v. Union of India32 had \\nexamined the aforesaid seven opinions and culled out the ratio to observe that the \\nlines of reasoning were different but nevertheless the judges had accepted the \\ninevitable- that while Parliament has ample and extensive powers of legislation, \\nthese would include the power to entrust some of the functions and powers to \\nanother body or authority.  At the same time, in Delhi Laws Act (supra) the judges \\nhad agreed that there should be limitations on such delegation. However, on the \\nquestion as to what is this limitation, there was a lack of consensus.  The two \\njudges in Ramesh Birch (supra) relying on the ratio in Delhi Laws Act (supra), \\nhad observed:  \\n \\n32 1990 AIR 560 \\n66“Some thought that there is no abdication or effacement unless it is total \\ni.e. unless Parliament surrenders its powers in favour of a \"parallel\" \\nlegislature or loses control over the local authority to such an extent as to \\nbe  unable  to  revoke  the  powers  given  to,  or  to  exercise  effective \\nsupervision over, the body entrusted therewith. But others were of opinion \\nthat such \"abdication\" or \"effacement\" could not even be partial and it \\nwould be bad if full powers to do everything that the legislature can do are \\nconferred on a subordinate authority, although the legislature may retain \\nthe power to control the action of such authority by recalling such power \\nor repealing the Acts passed by the subordinate authority. A different way \\nin which the second of the above views has been enunciated--and it is this \\nview which has dominated since--is by saying that the legislatures cannot \\nwash  their  hands  off  their  essential  legislative  function.  Essential \\nlegislative function consists in laying down the legislative policy with \\nsufficient clearness and in enunciating the standards which are to be \\nenacted into a rule of law. This cannot be delegated. What can be \\ndelegated is only the task of subordinate legislation which is by its very \\nnature ancillary to the statute which delegates the power to make it and \\nwhich must be within the policy and framework of the guidance provided \\nby the legislature.” \\n \\nThereupon the Division Bench had referred to the “policy and guideline” \\ntheory as a test to decide whether or not it is a case of excessive delegation which \\nit was observed means reference and giving proper regard to the context of the Act \\nand the object and purposes sought to be achieved which should be clear and it is \\nnot necessary that the legislation should “dot all the i’s and cross all the t’s of its \\npolicy”.  It is sufficient if it gives the broadest indication of the general policy of the \\nlegislature.   \\n135.  We would now refer to an earlier decision of this Court in Devi Das Gopal \\nKrishnan & Ors v. State of Punjab & Ors33 wherein K. Subba Rao, CJ. speaking \\nfor the Court had struck down Section 5 of the East Punjab General Sales Tax Act, \\n1948 which had empowered the State Government to fix rate of tax to such rate as \\nit deemed fit, as bad and unconstitutional observing that the needs of the State and \\nthe purposes of the Act did not provide sufficient guidance for fixing the rates of \\ntax.  It was observed: \\n \\n33 AIR 1967 SC 1895 \\n67“16. ...But in view of the multifarious activities of a welfare State, it cannot \\npresumably work out all the details to suit the varying aspects of a complex \\nsituation. It must necessarily delegate the working out of details to the \\nexecutive or any other agency. But there is a danger inherent in such a \\nprocess of delegation. An overburdened legislature or one controlled by a \\npowerful executive may unduly overstep the limits of delegation. It may \\nnot lay down any policy at all; it may declare its policy in vague and general \\nterms; it may not set down any standard for the guidance of the executive; \\nit may confer an arbitrary power on the executive to change or modify the \\npolicy  laid  down  by  it  without  reserving  for  itself  any  control  over \\nsubordinate legislation. This self effacement of legislative power in favour \\nof another agency either in whole or in part is beyond the permissible limits \\nof delegation. It is for a Court to hold on a fair, generous and liberal \\nconstruction of an impugned statute whether the legislature exceeded \\nsuch limits. But the said liberal on construction should not be carried by \\nthe Courts to the extent of always trying to discover a dormant or latent \\nlegislative policy to sustain an arbitrary power conferred on executive \\nauthorities. It is the duty of the Court to strike down without any hesitation \\nany arbitrary power conferred on the executive by the legislature.” \\n \\n136.  A year later in Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Birla Cotton, Spinning \\nand Weaving Mills, Delhi and Another34 this Court, however, upheld Section \\n113(2) of the Delhi Municipal Act, 1957 which had empowered the corporation to \\nlevy  certain optional  taxes by  observing  that  there  were  sufficient  guidelines, \\nsafeguards and checks in the Act which prevented excessive delegation as the Act \\nhad provided maximum rate of tax. It was observed that the nature of body to which \\ndelegation is made is also a relevant factor to be taken into consideration in \\ndetermining whether there is sufficient guidance in the matter of delegation and \\nalso when delegation is made to an elected body accountable to the people \\nincluding  those  who  paid  taxes,  as  this  acted  as  a  sufficient  check.    It  was \\nobserved: \\n“A review of these authorities therefore leads to the conclusion that so far \\nas this Court is concerned the principle is well established that essential \\nlegislative function consists of the determination of the legislative policy \\nand its formulation as a binding rule of conduct and cannot be delegated \\nby the legislature. Nor is there any unlimited right of delegation inherent \\nin the legislative power itself. This is not warranted by the provisions of \\nthe Constitution. The legislature must retain in its own hands the essential \\nlegislative functions and what can be delegated is the task of subordinate \\n \\n34 AIR 1968 SC 1232 \\n68legislation necessary for implementing the purposes and objects of the \\nAct. Where the legislative policy is enunciated with sufficient clearness or \\na standard is laid down, the courts should not interfere. What guidance \\nshould be given and to what extent and whether guidance has been given \\nin a particular case at all depends on a consideration of the provisions of \\nthe particular Act with which the Court has to deal including its preamble. \\nFurther it appears to us that the nature of the body to which delegation is \\nmade is also a factor to be taken into consideration in determining whether \\nthere is sufficient guidance in the matter of delegation.” \\n \\nThus, the guidelines in the form of providing maximum rates of tax up to \\nwhich a local body may be given discretion to make its choice or provision for \\nconsultation with the people of the local area and then fixing the rates or subjecting \\nthe rate of tax so fixed by the local authority to the approval of the Government \\nwhich acts as watch-dog were treated as satisfying the policy and guideline test.  \\n137.  This ratio was followed and expounded in M.K. Papiah & Sons v. Excise \\nCommissioner35 in which this Court had examined what constitutes essential \\nfeatures  that  the  legislature  cannot  delegate,  to  observe  that  this  cannot  be \\ndelineated in detail but nevertheless and certainly it does not include the change \\nof policy. The legislator is the master of the policy and the delegate is not free to \\nswitch  the  policy  for  then  it  would  be  usurpation  of  legislative  power  itself. \\nTherefore, when the question of the excessive delegation arises, investigation has \\nto be made whether policy of the legislation has not been indicated sufficiently or \\nwhether change of policy has been left to the pleasure of the delegate.  This aspect \\nis of substantial importance and relevance in the present case. \\n \\n138.  In Avinder Singh v. State of Punjab36 this Court had highlighted that the \\nfounding document, that is, the Constitution had created three instrumentalities \\n \\n35 (1975) 1 SCC 492 \\n36 (1979) 1 SCC 137 \\n69with  certain  basic  powers  and  it  is  axiomatic  that  legislative  powers  are  not \\nabdicated for this would mean betrayal of the Constitution and is intolerable in law. \\nTherefore, legislature cannot self-efface its personality and make over in terms the \\nplenary and  essential legislative  functions.   Nevertheless,  the complexities of \\nmodern  administration  are  bafflingly  intricate  and  present  themselves  with \\nurgencies and difficulties and the need for flexibility, which the direct legislation \\nmay not provide. Delegation of some part of the legislative powers therefore \\nbecame  inevitable  and  an  administrative  necessity.  Thus,  while  essential \\nlegislative policy cannot be delegated, however inessentials can be delegated over \\nto relevant agencies.   \\n \\n139.  Similar  opinion  was  expressed  in  Registrar  of  Coop.  Societies  v.  K. \\nKunjabmu37, wherein it has been observed: \\n“3. …They function best when they concern themselves with general \\nprinciples, broad objectives and fundamental issues instead of technical \\nand situational intricacies which are better left to better equipped full time \\nexpert executive bodies and specialist public servants. Parliament and the \\nState Legislatures have neither the time nor the expertise to be involved \\nin detail and circumstance. Nor can Parliament and the State Legislatures \\nvisualise and provide for new, strange, unforeseen and unpredictable \\nsituations arising from the complexity of modern life and the ingenuity of \\nmodern man. That is the raison d\\'etre for delegated legislation. That is \\nwhat  makes  delegated  legislation  inevitable  and  indispensable.  The \\nIndian Parliament arid the State Legislatures are endowed with plenary \\npower to legislate upon any of the subjects entrusted to them by the \\nConstitution, subject to the limitations imposed by the Constitution itself. \\nThe power to legislate carries with it the power to delegate. But excessive \\ndelegation may amount to abdication. Delegation unlimited may invite \\ndespotism  uninhibited.  So,  the  theory  has  been  evolved  that  the \\nlegislature cannot delegate its essential legislative function. Legislate it \\nmust by laying down policy and principle and delegate it may to fill in detail \\nand carry out policy. The legislature may guide the delegate by speaking \\nthrough  the  express  provision  empowering  delegation  or  the  other \\nprovisions of the statute, the preamble, the scheme or even the very \\nsubject matter of the statute. If guidance there is, wherever it may be \\nfound, the delegation is valid. A good deal of latitude has been held to be \\npermissible in the case of taxing statutes and on the same principle a \\ngenerous degree of latitude must be permissible in the case of welfare \\n \\n37 (1980) 1 SCC 340 \\n70legislation, particularly those statutes which are designed to further the \\nDirective Principles of State Policy.” \\n \\n \\nThe above decision states that the policy and principles test can be applied \\nthrough express provisions empowering delegation or any other provision of the \\nstatute including the preamble, the scheme or even the subject matter of the \\nstatute.  \\n140.  We will refer to a recent decision of this Court in Keshavlal Khemchand \\nand Son Private Limited & Others v. Union of India38 wherein a Division Bench \\nof this Court had observed that in spite of abundance of authority on the subject \\nwe are not blessed with certainty, and then observed that in Kunjabmu (supra) \\nthis Court had declined to consider whether M.K. Papiah & Sons (supra) had \\nbeaten the final retreat from the position enunciated in Delhi Laws Act (supra) and \\nhad proceeded to examine the theory of “policy and guidelines” referring to several \\njudgments.  The Division Bench then went on to observe that the earlier judgments \\nhad not been able to lay down the principle including as to what exactly constitutes \\n“essential legislative function”, but the following inferences can be drawn:  \\n“51.1  The  proposition  that  essential  legislative  functions  cannot  be \\ndelegated does not appear to be such a clearly settled proposition and \\nrequires a further examination which exercise is not undertaken by the \\ncounsel appearing in the matter. We leave it open for debate in a more \\nappropriate case on a future date.  For the present, we confine to the \\nexamination of the question: \\n‘Whether defining every expression used in an enactment is an \\nessential legislative function or not?’ \\n \\n51.2 All the judgments examined above recognize that there is a need for \\nsome amount of delegated legislation in the modern world. \\n \\n51.3  If  the  parent  enactment  enunciates  the  legislative  policy  with \\nsufficient clarity, delegation of the power to make subordinate legislation \\nto carry out the purpose of the parent enactment is permissible. \\n \\n51.4 Whether the policy of the legislature is sufficiently clear to guide the \\ndelegate depends upon the scheme and the provisions of the parent Act. \\n \\n38 (2015) 4 SCC 770 \\n71 \\n51.5 The nature of the body to whom the power is delegated is also a \\nrelevant factor in determining \"whether there is sufficient guidance in the \\nmatter of delegation.\" \\n \\n141.  Appropriate in regard to ‘policy and guideline’ test would be reference to yet \\nanother earlier judgment of this Court in Gwalior Rayon Silk Mfg. (Wvg.) Co. v. \\nAsstt.  Commissioner  of  Sales39  wherein  while  referring  to  the  views  of  an \\neminent American jurist Willioughby, it was stated: \\n“24. The matter has been dealt with on page 1637 of Vol. III in Willoughby \\non the Constitution of the United States, 2nd Edition, in the following \\nwords: \\n \\n\"The qualifications to the rule prohibiting the delegation of legislative \\npower which have been earlier adverted to are those which provide that \\nwhile the real law-making power may not be delegated, a discretionary \\nauthority may be granted to executive and administrative authorities: (1) \\nto determine in specific cases when and how the powers legislatively \\nconferred are to be exercised; and (2) to establish administrative rules and \\nregulations, binding both upon their subordinates and upon the public, \\nfixing in detail the manner in which the requirements of the statutes are to \\nbe met, and the rights therein created to be enjoyed.\" \\n \\n25. The matter has also been dealt with in Corpus Juris Secundum Vol. \\n73, page 324. It is stated there that the law-making power may not be \\ngranted to an administrative body to be exercised under the guise of \\nadministrative  discretion.  Accordingly,  in  delegating  powers  to  an \\nadministrative body with respect to the administration of statutes, the \\nLegislature must ordinarily prescribe a policy, standard, or rule for their \\nguidance and must not vest them with an arbitrary and uncontrolled \\ndiscretion with regard thereto, and a statute or ordinance which is deficient \\nin this respect is invalid. In other words, in order to avoid the pure \\ndelegation  of  legislative  power  by  the  creation  of  an  administrative \\nagency, the Legislature must set limits on such agency\\'s power and enjoin \\non  it  a  certain  course  of  procedure  and  rules  of  decision  in  the \\nperformance of its function; and, if the legislature fails to prescribe with \\nreasonable clarity the limits of power delegated to an administrative \\nagency, or if those limits are too broad, its attempt to delegate is a nullity.” \\n \\n \\n142.  It is in this context we have to examine whether the plea of excessive \\ndelegation would prevail and merits acceptance as Section 184 of the Finance Act \\ndoes not prescribe the qualifications for appointment, and terms and conditions of \\nservice.  It will be difficult to hold that Part XIV of the Finance Act suffers from the \\n \\n39 (1974) 4 SCC 98 \\n72vice of unguided delegation as it fails to clearly specify the eligibility qualifications \\nfor the Members,  Chairpersons,  Chairman  etc. of  different  Tribunals  as  such \\nrequirements, though important, are not per se functionally undelegatable.  \\n \\n143.  The objects of the parent enactments as well as the law laid down by this \\nCourt in R.K. Jain (supra), L Chandra Kumar (supra), R. Gandhi (supra), Madras \\nBar Association (supra) and Gujarat Urja Vikas (supra) undoubtedly bind the \\ndelegate and mandatorily requires the delegate under Section 184 to act strictly in \\nconformity with these decisions and the objects of delegated legislation stipulated \\nin the statutes. It must also be emphasised that the Finance Act, 2017 nowhere \\nindicates  that  the  legislature  had  intended  to  differ  from,  let  alone  make \\namendments, to remove the edifice and foundation of such decisions by enacting \\nthe Finance Act. Indeed, the learned Attorney General was clear in suggesting that \\nPart XIV was inserted with a view to incorporate the changes recommended by this \\nCourt in earlier decisions.  \\n \\n144.  Independence of a quasi-judicial authority like the tribunal highlighted in the \\nabove decisions would be, therefore, read as the policy and guideline applicable.  \\nPrinciple  of  independence  of  judiciary/tribunal  has  within  its  fold  two  broad \\nconcepts, as held in Supreme Court Advocates-On-Record Association and \\nAnother  v.  Union  of  India40  {See  paragraph  714},  (i)  independence  of  an \\nindividual judge, that is, decisional independence; and (ii) independence of the \\njudiciary or the Tribunal as an institution or an organ of the State, that is, functional \\n \\n40 (2016) 5 SCC 1 \\n73independence. Individual independence has various facets which include security \\nof tenure, procedure for renewal, terms and conditions of service like salary, \\nallowances, etc. which should be fair and just and which should be protected and \\nnot  varied  to  his/her  disadvantage  after  appointment.    Independence  of  the \\ninstitution refers to sufficient degree of separation from other branches of the \\ngovernment, especially when the branch is a litigant or one of the parties before \\nthe tribunal.  Functional independence would include method of selection and \\nqualifications prescribed, as independence begins with appointment of persons of \\ncalibre, ability and integrity. Protection from interference and independence from \\nthe executive pressure, fearlessness from other power centres – economic and \\npolitical, and freedom from prejudices acquired and nurtured by the class to which \\nthe adjudicator belongs, are important attributes of institutional independence. \\n \\n145.  Further,  cursory  examination  of  the  specified  enactments  mentioned  in \\ncolumn (3) of the Eighth Schedule reveals that most enactments did not stipulate \\nthe manner of appointment, terms of office, salaries and allowances, resignation, \\nremoval,  that  is,  the  terms  and  conditions  of  service,  which  stipulations  are \\ndelegated and they are not part of the principal enactment. For example, sub-\\nsection (1) of Section 252 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 states that the Central \\nGovernment may constitute the Appellate Tribunal consisting of as many judicial \\nand accountant members as it thinks fit to exercise the powers and discharge the \\nfunctions prescribed by the Act. Sub-sections (3) and (4) state that the Central \\nGovernment shall ordinarily appoint a judicial Member as the President and may \\nappoint one or more members as Vice President or Senior Vice President.  Sub-\\nsection (2) prescribes the eligibility requirements for being a judicial member and \\n74sub-section (2A) stipulates the eligibility requirements for being an administrative \\nmember.  The Income Tax Act does not prescribe or stipulate manner or method \\nfor selection or terms and conditions of service.  This is equally true for the \\nAppellate Tribunal constituted under the Central Excise Act.   \\n \\n146.  Wanchoo,  CJ.  in  The  Municipal  Corporation  of  Delhi  (supra)  had \\nobserved: \\n“13. The question as to the limits of permissible delegation of legislative power \\nby a legislature to a subordinate authority has come before this Court in a \\nnumber of cases and the law as laid down by this Court is not in doubt now. \\nConsidering the complexity of modern life it is recognised on all hands that \\nlegislature cannot possibly have time to legislate in every minute detail. That is \\nwhy it has been recognised that it is open to the legislature to delegate to \\nsubordinate authorities the power to make ancillary rules for the purpose of \\ncarrying out the intention of the legislature indicated in the law which gives power \\nto frame such ancillary rules. The matter came before this Court for the first time \\nIn re The Delhi Laws Act, 1912 and it was held in that case that it could not be \\nsaid that an unlimited right of delegation was inherent in the legislative power \\nitself. This was not warranted by the provisions of the Constitution, which vested \\nthe power of legislation either in Parliament or State legislatures and the \\nlegitimacy of delegation depended upon its being used as an ancillary measure \\nwhich the legislature considered to be necessary for the purpose of exercising \\nits legislative powers effectively and completely. The legislature must retain in \\nits  own  hands  the  essential  legislative  function.  Exactly  what  constituted \\n“essential legislative function”, it was held further, was difficult to define in \\ngeneral terms, but this much was clear that the essential legislative function must \\nat least consist of the determination of the legislative policy and its formulation \\nas a binding rule of conduct. Thus where the law passed by the legislature \\ndeclares the legislative policy and lays down the standard which is enacted into \\na rule of law, it can leave the task of subordinate legislation which by its very \\nnature is ancillary to the statute to subordinate bodies i.e. the making of rules, \\nregulations or bye-laws. The subordinate authority must do so within the frame-\\nwork of the law which makes the delegation, and such subordinate legislation \\nhas to be consistent with the law under which it is made and cannot go beyond \\nthe limits of the policy and standard laid down in the law. Provided the legislative \\npolicy is enunciated with sufficient clearness or a standard is laid down, the \\ncourts should not interfere with the discretion that undoubtedly rests with the \\nlegislature itself in determining the extent of delegation necessary in a particular \\ncase. \\n \\nxx   xx    xx \\n \\n28. A review of these authorities therefore leads to the conclusion that so far as \\nthis Court is concerned the principle is well established that essential legislative \\nfunction consists of the determination of the legislative policy and its formulation \\nas a binding rule of conduct and cannot be delegated by the legislature. Nor is \\nthere any unlimited right of delegation inherent in the legislative power itself. This \\nis not warranted by the provisions of the Constitution. The legislature must retain \\nin its own hands the essential legislative functions and what can be delegated is \\nthe task of subordinate legislation necessary for implementing the purposes and \\n75objects of the Act. Where the legislative policy is enunciated with sufficient \\nclearness or a standard is laid down, the courts should not interfere. What \\nguidance should be given and to what extent and whether guidance has been \\ngiven in a particular case at all depends on a consideration of the provisions of \\nthe particular Act with which the Court has to deal including its preamble. Further \\nit appears to us that the nature of the body to which delegation is made is also a \\nfactor to be taken into consideration in determining whether there is sufficient \\nguidance in the matter of delegation.” \\n \\n \\n147.  Referring to The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (supra), this Court in \\nKeshav Lal, had observed: \\n \\n“45. ... The Court held that there was no impermissible delegation of legislative \\npower. Hidayatullah, J. speaking for himself and for Ramaswami, J. agreed with \\nthe  conclusion  reached  at  by  Wanchoo,  C.J.,  though  on  slightly  different \\nreasons.” \\n \\n \\n148.  On examining the Constitutional scheme, the statutes which had created \\ntribunals and the precedents of this Court laying down attributes of independence \\nof  tribunals  in  different  facets,  we  do  not  think  that  the  power  to  prescribe \\nqualifications, selection procedure and service conditions of members and other \\noffice holders of the tribunals is intended to vest solely with the Legislature for all \\ntimes  and  purposes.    Policy  and  guidelines  exist.    Subject  to  aforesaid,  the \\nsubmission of learned Attorney General that Section 184 was inserted to bring \\nuniformity and with a view to harmonise the diverse and wide-ranging qualifications \\nand methods of appointment across different tribunals carries weight and, in our \\nview, needs to be accepted. \\n \\n149.   Cautioning against the potential misuse of Section 184 by the executive, it \\nwas  vehemently  argued  by  the  learned counsel  for  the  petitioner(s)  that  any \\ndesecration by the Executive of such powers threatens and poses a risk to the \\nindependence  of  the  tribunals.  A  mere  possibility  or  eventuality  of  abuse  of \\n76delegated powers in the absence of any evidence supporting such claim, cannot \\nbe a ground for striking down the provisions of the Finance Act, 2017. It is always \\nopen to a Constitutional court on challenge made to the delegated legislation \\nframed by the Executive to examine whether it conforms to the parent legislation \\nand other laws, and apply the “policy and guideline” test and if found contrary, can \\nbe struck down without affecting the constitutionality of the rule making power \\nconferred under Section 186 of the Finance Act, 2017. \\nISSUE III:  IF SECTION 184 IS VALID, WHETHER TRIBUNAL, APPELLATE TRIBUNAL \\nAND OTHER AUTHORITIES (QUALIFICATIONS, EXPERIENCE AND OTHER CONDITIONS OF \\nSERVICE OF MEMBERS) RULES, 2017 ARE IN CONSONANCE WITH THE PRINCIPAL ACT \\nAND VARIOUS DECISIONS OF THIS COURT ON FUNCTIONING OF TRIBUNALS?  \\n150.  Given that the Central Government has formulated the Tribunal, Appellate \\nTribunal and other Authorities (Qualifications, Experience and other Conditions of \\nService of Members) Rules, 2017, (hereinafter referred to as “the Rules”) under \\nSection 184 of the Finance Act, 2017, it is necessary at this stage to examine \\nwhether the Rules conform to the judicial principles inherent in our Constitutional \\nscheme as established by this Court in its earlier dicta. Some salient provisions of \\nthe Rules are extracted hereunder: \\n “TRIBUNAL,  APPELLATE  TRIBUNAL  AND  OTHER  AUTHORITIES  (QUALIFICATIONS, \\nEXPERIENCE AND OTHER CONDITIONS OF SERVICE OF MEMBERS) RULES, 2017 \\nxxxxxx \\n3.

The  composition  of  some  of  the  Search-cum-Selection  Committees,  as \\nprovided in the Rules, have been reproduced below illustratively: \\n\"Industrial Tribunal: \\nSearch-cum-Selection Committee for the post of the Presiding Officer, -  \\n(i)  a person to be nominated by the Central Government-chairperson;  \\n(ii)  Secretary to the Government of India, Ministry of Labour and Employment- \\nmember;  \\n(iii)  .Secretary to the Government of India to be nominated by the Central \\nGovernment-member;  \\n(iv)  two experts to be nominated by the Central Government- members. \\n \\n \\n \\n82Income Tax Appellate Tribunal: \\n(A) Search-cum-Selection Committee for the post  of the President and  Vice-\\nPresident, -  \\n(i) a sitting Judge of Supreme Court to be nominated by the Chief Justice of India-\\nchairperson;  \\n(ii) the President, Income-tax Appellate Tribunal-member; and  \\n(iii)  the  Secretary  to  the  Government  of  India,  Ministry  of  Law  and  Justice \\n(Department of Legal Affairs)- member.  \\n(B) Search-cum-Selection Committee for the Accountant Member and Judicial \\nMember, – \\n(i) a nominee of the Minister of Law and Justice-chairperson;  \\n(ii) Secretary to the Government of India, Ministry of Law and Justice (Department \\nof Legal Affairs)- member;  \\n(iii) President of the Income tax Appellate Tribunal – member; and  \\n(iv) such other persons, if any, not exceeding two, as the Minister of Law and Justice \\nmay appoint-member. \\n \\nCentral Administrative Tribunal: \\n(A)  Search-cum-Selection  Committee  for  the  post  of  Chairman  and  Judicial \\nMember, –  \\n(i) Chief Justice of India or his nominee- chairperson;  \\n(ii) Chairman of the Central Administrative Tribunal, Principal Bench – member;  \\n(iii) Secretary to the Government of India, (Department of Personnel and Training)- \\nmember;  \\n(iv) Secretary to the Government of India, Ministry of Law and Justice -member;  \\n(v) one expert, to be nominated by the Central Government of India - member.  \\n(B) Search-cum-Selection Committee for the post of Administrative Member, –  \\n(a) a person to be nominated by the Central Government - chairperson;  \\n(b) Chairman of the, Central Administrative Tribunal – member; \\n(c) Secretary to the Government of India, (Department of Personnel and Training)- \\nmember;  \\n(d) Secretary to the Government of India, Ministry of Law and Justice -member;  \\n(e) one expert, to be nominated by the Government of India - member.” \\n152.  Composition of a Search-cum-Selection Committee is contemplated in a \\nmanner  whereby  appointments  of  Member,  Vice-President  and  President  are \\npredominantly made by nominees of the Central Government. A perusal of the \\nSchedule to the Rules shows that save for token representation of the Chief Justice \\n83of India or his nominee in some Committees, the role of the judiciary is virtually \\nabsent.  \\n \\n153.  We are in agreement with the contentions of the Learned Counsel for the \\npetitioner(s),  that  the  lack  of  judicial  dominance  in  the  Search-cum-Selection \\nCommittee is in direct contravention of the doctrine of separation of powers and is \\nan encroachment on the judicial domain. The doctrine of separation of powers has \\nbeen well recognised and re-interpreted by this Court as an important facet of the \\nbasic structure of the Constitution, in its dictum in Kesavananda Bharati v. State \\nof Kerala41, and several other later decisions. The exclusion of the Judiciary from \\nthe control and influence of the Executive is not limited to traditional Courts alone, \\nbut also includes Tribunals since they are formed as an alternative to Courts and \\nperform judicial functions. \\n \\n154.  Clearly, the composition of the Search-cum-Selection Committees under the \\nRules  amounts  to  excessive  interference  of  the  Executive  in  appointment  of \\nmembers and presiding officers of statutory Tribunals and would undoubtedly be \\ndetrimental to the independence of judiciary besides being an affront to the doctrine \\nof separation of powers. \\n \\n155.  In R.K. Jain v. Union of India (supra), a three-Judge Bench of this Court \\nasserted the need for independent system of appointment and administration of \\n \\n41 (1973) 4 SCC 225 \\n84Tribunals to maintain public trust in the judiciary while expressing its agony over \\ninefficacy of the working of Tribunals in the country. In addition to discussing the \\nperils of providing direct statutory appeals to the Apex Court from the Tribunals, it \\nwas also suggested that there is an imminent need for reform in the manner of \\nrecruitment of members of Tribunals to maintain public faith in the institution of \\njudiciary.   Adjudication of disputes by technical members should be confined only \\nto cases requiring specialised technical knowledge. [Union of India vs. Madras \\nBar Association42 and Madras Bar Association vs. Union of India & Anr.43] \\n156.  Subsequently, in its dictum in L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India (supra), \\na  seven-Judge  Bench  of  this  Court  noted  the  observations  in  the  Malimath \\nCommittee  Report,  discussing  the  administration  of  the  Tribunals  established \\nunder Article 323-A and Article 323-B of the Constitution. The Malimath Committee \\nReport had pointed out that a Tribunal constituted in substitution of any other Court \\nshould have similar standards of appointment, qualifications and conditions of \\nservice,  to  inspire  the  confidence  of  the  public  at  large.  Shortcomings  in \\ncomposition, tenure, conditions of service, etc. of the Members of Tribunals were \\nalso  highlighted  in  the  Report  as  reasons  for  increased  intervention  by  the \\nExecutive in the working of judicial institutions. The relevant extract is reproduced \\nbelow: \\n“88. …The observations contained in the Report, to this extent they contain a review \\nof the functioning of the Tribunals over a period of three years or so after their \\ninstitution, will be useful for our purpose. Chapter VIII of the second volume of the \\nReport, “Alternative Modes and Forums for Dispute Resolution”, deals with the issue \\nat length. After forwarding its specific recommendations on the feasibility of setting \\nup  “Gram  Nyayalayas”,  Industrial  Tribunals  and  Educational  Tribunals,  the \\nCommittee has dealt with the issue of Tribunals set up under Articles 323-A and \\n \\n42 (2010) 11 SCC 1 \\n43 (2014) 10 SCC 1 [Para 107 & 126] \\n85323-B  of  the  Constitution.  The  relevant  observations  in  this  regard,  being  of \\nconsiderable significance to our analysis, are extracted in full as under: \\n“Functioning of Tribunals \\n8.63 Several tribunals are functioning in the country. Not all of them, however, \\nhave inspired confidence in the public mind. The reasons are not far to seek. \\nThe foremost is the lack of competence, objectivity and judicial approach. \\nThe next is their constitution, the power and method of appointment of \\npersonnel thereto, the inferior status and the casual method of working. The \\nlast is their actual composition; men of calibre are not willing to be appointed \\nas presiding officers in view of the uncertainty of tenure, unsatisfactory \\nconditions of service, executive subordination in matters of administration \\nand political interference in judicial functioning. For these and other reasons, \\nthe quality of justice is stated to have suffered and the cause of expedition is \\nnot found to have been served by the establishment of such tribunals. \\n8.64 Even the experiment of setting up of the Administrative Tribunals under \\nthe Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985, has not been widely welcomed. Its \\nmembers have been selected from all kinds of services including the Indian \\nPolice Service. The decision of the State Administrative Tribunals are not \\nappealable except under Article 136 of the Constitution. On account of the \\nheavy cost and remoteness of the forum, there is virtual negation of the right \\nof appeal. This has led to denial of justice in many cases and consequential \\ndissatisfaction. There appears to be a move in some of the States where they \\nhave been established for their abolition. \\nTribunals — Tests for Including High Court\\'s Jurisdiction \\n8.65 A Tribunal which substitutes the High Court as an alternative institutional \\nmechanism for judicial review must be no less efficacious than the High \\nCourt. Such a tribunal must inspire confidence and public esteem that it is a \\nhighly  competent  and  expert  mechanism  with  judicial  approach  and \\nobjectivity. What is needed in a tribunal, which is intended to supplant the \\nHigh Court, is legal training and experience, and judicial acumen, equipment \\nand approach. When such a tribunal is composed of personnel drawn from \\nthe judiciary as well as from services or from amongst experts in the field, \\nany weightage in favour of the service members or expert members and \\nvalue-discounting  the  judicial  members  would  render  the  tribunal  less \\neffective and efficacious than the High Court. The Act setting up such a \\ntribunal would itself have to be declared as void under such circumstances. \\nThe same would not at all be conducive to judicial independence and may \\neven tend, directly or indirectly, to influence their decision-making process, \\nespecially when the Government is a litigant in most of the cases coming \\nbefore such tribunal. (See S.P. Sampath Kumar v. Union of India, (1987) 1 \\nSCC 124) The protagonists of specialist tribunals, who simultaneously with \\ntheir establishment want exclusion of the writ jurisdiction of the High Courts \\nin regard to matters entrusted for adjudication to such tribunals, ought not to \\noverlook these vital and important aspects. It must not be forgotten that what \\nis permissible to be supplanted by another equally effective and efficacious \\ninstitutional mechanism is the High Courts and not the judicial review itself. \\nTribunals are not an end in themselves but a means to an end; even if the \\nlaudable objectives of speedy justice, uniformity of approach, predictability of \\ndecisions and specialist justice are to be achieved, the framework of the \\ntribunal intended to be set up to attain them must still retain its basic judicial \\n86character and inspire public confidence. Any scheme of decentralisation of \\nadministration of justice providing for an alternative institutional mechanism \\nin substitution of the High Courts must pass the aforesaid test in order to be \\nconstitutionally valid….”\" \\n \\n157.  We are of the view that the Search-cum-Selection Committee as formulated \\nunder the Rules is an attempt to keep the judiciary away from the process of \\nselection  and  appointment  of  Members,  Vice-Chairman  and  Chairman  of \\nTribunals. This Court has been lucid in its ruling in Supreme Court Advocates-\\non-Record Assn. v. Union of India44 (Fourth Judges Case), wherein it was held \\nthat primacy of judiciary is imperative in selection and appointment of judicial \\nofficers including Judges of High Court and Supreme Court. Cognisant of the \\ndoctrine of Separation of Powers, it is important that judicial appointments take \\nplace  without  any  influence  or  control  of  any  other  limb  of  the  sovereign. \\nIndependence of judiciary is the only means to maintain a system of checks and \\nbalances on the working of Legislature and the Executive. The Executive is a \\nlitigating party in most of the litigation and hence cannot be allowed to be a \\ndominant participant in judicial appointments.  \\n158.  We  are  in  complete  agreement  with  the  analogy  elucidated  by  the \\nConstitution Bench in the Fourth Judges Case (supra) for compulsory need for \\nexclusion  of  control  of  the  Executive  over  quasi-judicial  bodies  of  Tribunals \\ndischarging responsibilities akin to Courts. The Search-cum-Selection Committees \\nas envisaged in the Rules are against the constitutional scheme inasmuch as they \\n \\n44 (2016) 5 SCC 1. \\n87dilute the involvement of judiciary in the process of appointment of members of \\ntribunals which is in effect an encroachment by the executive on the judiciary.   \\n(B) Qualifications of members and presiding officers \\n159.  The  Rules  also  prescribe  the  qualifications  for  Chairperson,  Vice-\\nChairperson, Member, etc. of both judicial and technical members. A bare perusal \\nof the Rules reveals that while prescribing the qualifications of technical member, \\nthe prior dicta of this Court has been ignored by the Central Government inasmuch \\nas  the  technical  members  are  being  appointed  without  any  adjudicatory \\nexperience.  The  qualifications  for  appointment  as  technical  member  in  the \\nCustoms, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal as prescribed under the \\nRules are illustratively reproduced below: \\n\"(1) A person shall not be qualified for appointment as President unless, - \\n(a) he is or has been a Judge of a High Court; or \\n(b) he is the member of the Appellate Tribunal. \\n(2) A person shall not be qualified for appointment as a Judicial Member, unless, - \\n(a) he has for at least ten years held a judicial office in the territory of India; \\nor \\n(b) he has been a member of the Indian Legal Service and has held a post in \\nGrade-I of that Service or any equivalent or higher post for at least three \\nyears; or \\n(c) he has been an advocate for at least ten years. \\n(3) A person shall not be qualified for appointment as a Technical Member unless \\nhe has been a member of the Indian Revenue Service (Customs and Central Excise \\nService Group \\'A\\') and has held the post of Commissioner of Customs or Central \\nExcise or any equivalent or higher post for at least three years.\" \\n \\n160.  In addition to this, there has been a blatant dilution of judicial character in \\nappointments whereby candidates without any judicial experience are prescribed \\nto  be  eligible  for  adjudicatory  posts  such  as  that  of  the  Presiding  Officer. \\n88Illustratively,  the  qualifications  for  Presiding  Officer  in  Industrial  Tribunal  as \\nspecified in the Rules may be noticed below: \\n“A person shall not be qualified for appointment as Presiding Officer, unless he, - \\n(a) is, or has been, or is qualified to be, a Judge of a High Court; or \\n(b) he has, for a period of not less than three-years, been a District Judge or an \\nAdditional District Judge; or \\n(c) is a person of ability, integrity and standing, and having special knowledge of, \\nand professional experience of not less than twenty years in economics, business, \\ncommerce,  law,  finance,  management,  industry,  public  affairs,  administration, \\nlabour relations, industrial disputes or any other matter which in the opinion of the \\nCentral Government is useful to the Industrial Tribunal.” \\n \\n161.   The contentions of the Learned Counsel for petitioner(s) are, therefore, duly \\naccepted by this Court insofar as it is contended that the Rules have an effect of \\ndilution of the judicial character in adjudicatory positions. It has been repeatedly \\nruled by this Court in a catena of decisions that judicial functions cannot be \\nperformed by technical members devoid of any adjudicatory experience.  \\n \\n162.  In Madras Bar Assn. v. Union of India (supra), a five-judge Bench of this \\nCourt reiterated the urgent need to monitor the pressure and/or influence of the \\nexecutive on the Members of the Tribunals. It was asserted that any Tribunal which \\nsought to replace the High Court must be no less independent or judicious in its \\ncomposition. It was also clarified that the Members of the Tribunal, replacing any \\nCourt, including the High Court must possess expertise in law and shall have \\nappropriate legal experience. Even though Parliament can transfer jurisdiction from \\nthe  traditional  Courts  to  any  other  analogous  Tribunal,  the  Tribunal  must  be \\nmanned by members having qualifications equivalent to that of the Court from \\nwhich adjudicatory function is transferred. Hence, any adjudication transferred to \\n89a Technical or Non-Judicial member is a clear act of dilution and an encroachment \\nupon the independence of judiciary. It was further ruled by this Court that even \\nthough the legislature has the powers to reorganise or prescribe qualifications for \\nmembers of Tribunals, it is open for this Court to exercise “judicial review” of the \\nprescribed standards, if the adjudicatory standards are adversely affected. The \\ndecision of this Court read as follows: \\n“105. … It was also sought to be asserted that the tribunal constituted under the \\nenactment being a substitute of the High Court ought to have been constituted in a \\nmanner that it would be able to function in the same manner as the High Court itself. \\nSince insulation of the judiciary from all forms of interference even from the \\ncoordinate branches of the Government was by now being perceived as a basic \\nessential feature of the Constitution, it was felt that the same independence from \\npossibility  of  executive  pressure  or  influence  needed  to  be  ensured  for  the \\nChairman, Vice-Chairman and Members of the Administrative Tribunal. In recording \\nits conclusions, even though it was maintained that “judicial review” was an integral \\npart of the “basic structure” of the Constitution yet it was held that Parliament was \\ncompetent to amend the Constitution, and substitute in place of the High Court \\nanother alternative institutional mechanism or arrangement. This Court, however \\ncautioned that it was imperative to ensure that the alternative arrangement was no \\nless independent and no less judicious than the High Court (which was sought to be \\nreplaced) itself. \\nxxx \\n107.  In  Union  of  India  v.  Madras  Bar  Assn.  [(2010)  11  SCC  1]  ,  all  the \\nconclusions/propositions narrated above were reiterated and followed, whereupon \\nthe fundamental requirements which need to be kept in mind while transferring \\nadjudicatory functions from courts to tribunals were further crystallised. It came to \\nbe unequivocally recorded that tribunals vested with judicial power (hitherto before \\nvested in, or exercised by courts), should possess the same independence, security \\nand capacity, as the courts which the tribunals are mandated to substitute. The \\nmembers of the tribunals discharging judicial functions could only be drawn from \\nsources possessed of expertise in law and competent to discharge judicial functions. \\nTechnical members can be appointed to tribunals where technical expertise is \\nessential for disposal of matters, and not otherwise. Therefore it was held that where \\nthe adjudicatory process transferred to tribunals did not involve any specialised skill, \\nknowledge or expertise, a provision for appointment of technical members (in \\naddition to, or in substitution of judicial members) would constitute a clear case of \\ndelusion and encroachment upon the independence of the judiciary and the “rule of \\nlaw”. The stature of the members, who would constitute the tribunal, would depend \\non the jurisdiction which was being transferred to the tribunal. In other words, if the \\njurisdiction of the High Court was transferred to a tribunal, the stature of the \\nmembers of the newly constituted tribunal, should be possessed of qualifications \\nakin to the Judges of the High Court. Whereas in case, the jurisdiction and the \\nfunctions sought to be transferred were being exercised/performed by District \\nJudges, the Members appointed to the tribunal should be possessed of equivalent \\n90qualifications and commensurate stature of District Judges. The conditions of \\nservice of the members should be such that they are in a position to discharge their \\nduties in an independent and impartial manner. The manner of their appointment \\nand removal including their transfer, and tenure of their employment, should have \\nadequate protection so as to be shorn of legislative and executive interference. The \\nfunctioning of the tribunals, their infrastructure and responsibility of fulfilling their \\nadministrative requirements ought to be assigned to the Ministry of Law and Justice. \\nNeither the tribunals nor their members, should be required to seek any facilities \\nfrom the parent ministries or department concerned. Even though the legislature can \\nreorganise  the  jurisdiction  of  judicial  tribunals,  and  can  prescribe  the \\nqualifications/eligibility of members thereof, the same would be subject to “judicial \\nreview” wherein it would be open to a court to hold that the tribunalisation would \\nadversely affect the adjudicatory standards, whereupon it would be open to a court \\nto interfere therewith. Such an exercise would naturally be a part of the checks and \\nbalances measures conferred by the Constitution on the judiciary to maintain the \\nrule of “separation of powers” to prevent any encroachment by the legislature or the \\nexecutive. \\nxxx \\n113.2. …The power of discharging judicial functions which was exercised by \\nmembers of the higher judiciary at the time when the Constitution came into force \\nshould ordinarily remain with the court, which exercised the said jurisdiction at the \\ntime of promulgation of the new Constitution. But the judicial power could be allowed \\nto  be  exercised  by  an  analogous/similar  court/tribunal  with  a  different  name. \\nHowever, by virtue of the constitutional convention while constituting the analogous \\ncourt/tribunal it will have to be ensured that the appointment and security of tenure \\nof Judges of that court would be the same as of the court sought to be substituted. \\nThis was the express conclusion drawn in Hinds case [Hinds v. R., 1977 AC 195] . \\nIn Hinds case, it was acknowledged that Parliament was not precluded from \\nestablishing a court under a new name to exercise the jurisdiction that was being \\nexercised by members of the higher judiciary at the time when the Constitution came \\ninto force. But when that was done, it was critical to ensure that the persons \\nappointed to be members of such a court/tribunal should be appointed in the same \\nmanner and should be entitled to the same security of tenure as the holder of the \\njudicial office at the time when the Constitution came into force. Even in the treatise \\nConstitutional Law of Canada by Peter W. Hogg, it was observed: if a province \\ninvested a tribunal with a jurisdiction of a kind, which ought to properly belong to a \\nSuperior, District or County Court, then that court/tribunal (created in its place), \\nwhatever is its official name, for constitutional purposes has to, while replacing a \\nSuperior, District or County Court, satisfy the requirements and standards of the \\nsubstituted court. This would mean that the newly constituted court/tribunal will be \\ndeemed to be invalidly constituted, till its members are appointed in the same \\nmanner, and till its members are entitled to the same conditions of service as were \\navailable to the Judges of the court sought to be substituted. In the judgments under \\nreference it has also been concluded that a breach of the above constitutional \\nconvention could not be excused by good intention (by which the legislative power \\nhad been exercised to enact a given law). We are satisfied, that the aforesaid \\nexposition of law is in consonance with the position expressed by this Court while \\ndealing with the concepts of “separation of powers”, the “rule of law” and “judicial \\nreview”. In this behalf, reference may be made to the judgments in L. Chandra \\nKumar case, as also, in Union of India v. Madras Bar Assn. (2010). Therein, this \\nCourt has recognised that transfer of jurisdiction is permissible but in effecting such \\n91transfer, the court to which the power of adjudication is transferred must be endured \\nwith salient characteristics, which were possessed by the court from which the \\nadjudicatory power has been transferred… \\nXXX \\n128. There seems to be no doubt, whatsoever, that the Members of a court/tribunal \\nto  which  adjudicatory  functions  are  transferred  must  be  manned  by \\nJudges/members whose stature and qualifications are commensurate to the court \\nfrom  which  the  adjudicatory  process  has  been  transferred.  This  position  is \\nrecognised the world over. The constitutional conventions in respect of Jamaica, \\nCeylon, Australia and Canada, on this aspect of the matter have been delineated \\nabove. The opinion of the Privy Council expressed by Lord Diplock in Hinds case, \\nhas been shown as being followed in countries which have Constitutions on the \\nWestminster model. The Indian Constitution is one such constitution. The position \\nhas been clearly recorded while interpreting Constitutions framed on the above \\nmodel, namely, that even though the legislature can transfer judicial power from a \\ntraditional  court  to  an  analogous  court/tribunal  with  a  different  name,  the \\ncourt/tribunal to which such power is transferred should be possessed of the same \\nsalient characteristics, standards and parameters, as the court the power whereof \\nwas being transferred. It is not possible for us to accept that Accountant Members \\nand Technical Members have the stature and qualification possessed by the Judges \\nof High Courts.” \\n \\n163.  We concur with the above which reiterates the consistent view taken by this \\nCourt  in  a  number  of  cases.    It  is  also  a  well-established  principle  followed \\nthroughout in various other jurisdictions as well, that wherever Parliament decides \\nto divest the traditional Courts of their jurisdiction and transfer the lis to some other \\nanalogous Court/Tribunal, the qualification and acumen of the members in such \\nTribunal must be commensurate with that of the Court from which the adjudicatory \\nfunction is transferred. Adjudication of disputes which was originally vested in \\nJudges of Courts, if done by technical or non-judicial member, is clearly a dilution \\nand encroachment on judicial domain. With great respect, Parliament cannot divest \\njudicial  functions  upon  technical  members,  devoid  of  the  either  adjudicatory \\nexperience or legal knowledge. \\n164.  It is necessary to notice few other changes brought about by the new Rules.  \\nFirstly,  most  Tribunals  were  earlier  headed  by  judicial  members.    With  the \\n92exception of some Tribunals like the Debt Recovery Tribunal, presiding officers \\nwere retired judges either of the Supreme Court or of High Courts.  Under the \\npresent formulation of Rules, the Central Government has widened eligibility by \\nmaking persons who otherwise have no judicial or legal experience but if they are \\notherwise of “ability, integrity and standing, and having special knowledge of, and \\nprofessional experience of” certain specialised subjects “which in the opinion of the \\nCentral Government is useful” eligible for being appointed as presiding officers.  \\nFurther, others who are “qualified to be” Supreme Court and High Court judges can \\nalso head Tribunals.  A perusal of Articles 124(3) and 217(2) of the Constitution \\nshows that it specifies only the very minimum prerequisites for appointment as a \\njudge  of  the  Constitutional  Courts.    Instead,  a  predominant  portion  of  the \\nconsideration for appointment to this Court or to the High Courts is uncodified and \\nis based on a holistic consideration of the practice, legal acumen, expertise and \\ncharacter of Advocates.  The effect of the new criteria would be to make every \\nsecond  advocate  eligible,  in  effect,  vastly  diluting  the  qualifications  for \\nappointment.  The characteristics necessary of such people are also vague which \\nresultantly  increases  executive  discretion.      It  thus  affects  both  judicial \\nindependence as well as capability and competency of these Tribunals.  The \\npower/discretion vested to specify qualifications and decide who should man the \\nTribunals has to be exercised keeping in view the larger public interest and the \\nsame must be just, fair and reasonable and not vague or imprecise.   \\n165.  At this juncture it must also be reiterated that equality can only be amongst \\nequals, and that it would be impermissible to treat unequals equally on the basis \\nof undefined contours of ‘Uniformity’.  A Tribunal to have the character of a quasi-\\n93judicial body and a legitimate replacement of Courts, must essentially possess a \\ndominant  judicial  character  through  their  members/presiding  officers.    It  was \\nobserved in Madras Bar Association (2010) (supra) that it is a fundamental \\nprerequisite for transferring adjudicatory functions from Courts to Tribunals that the \\nlatter must possess the same capacity and independence as the former, and that \\nmembers as well as the presiding officers of Tribunals must have significant judicial \\ntraining and legal experience.  Further, knowledge, training and experience of \\nmembers/presiding officers of a Tribunal must mirror, as far as possible, that of the \\nCourt which it seeks to substitute.  Illustratively, the composition of Appellate \\nTribunal under the Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of \\nProperty) Act, 1976, delineating this incongruity is reproduced below for reference: \\nAppellate Tribunal under the Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture \\nof Property) Act, 1976 \\n(1)  The Chairman of the Appellate Tribunal shall be a person who is or has been \\nor is qualified to be a Judge of a Supreme Court or a Judge of a High Court. \\n(2)  The Member of the Appellate Tribunal shall be a person not below the rank of \\nJoint Secretary to the Government of India. \\n \\n166.  It appears to us to be incomprehensible as to how both Supreme Court and \\nHigh  Court  judges  can  be  eligible  for  the  same  post  when  their  experience, \\nexposure, knowledge and stature under the Constitution are vastly different and \\nthe two do not form one homogenous class.  There can be no forced equality \\nbetween the two.  Doing so would be suggestive of non-application of mind.  Such \\nan exercise would merit judicial interference.  \\n167.  Further,  dispensation  of  justice  requires  that  the  adjudicating  institution \\ncommand respect with the populace.  Anomalous situations created by allowing \\n94High Court judges to be appointed to a position occupied earlier by a Supreme \\nCourt judge, affects the prestige of the Judiciary as an institution.   \\n168.  The stature of the people manning an institution lends credibility and colour \\nto the institution itself.  There is a perceptible signalling effect in having retired \\nSupreme Court justices as presiding officers of a particular Tribunal of National \\nimportance.  The same instils an inherent fairness, dignity and exalted status in the \\nTribunal.  Permitting such institutions to be also occupied by persons who have not \\nmanned an equivalent position or those with lesser judicial experience, does not \\nbode well for the Tribunal besides discouraging competent people from offering \\ntheir services.  On the same analogy, it would be an anathema to say that High \\nCourt judges and District Court judges can both occupy the same position in a \\nTribunal.   \\n(C) Constitutionality of procedure of removal \\n169.  It  is  clear  from  the  Scheme  contemplated  under  the  Rules  that  the \\ngovernment has significantly diluted the role of the Judiciary in appointment of \\njudicial members.  Further, in many Tribunals like the NGT, the role of the Judiciary \\nin appointment of non-judicial members has entirely been taken away.  Such a \\npractice violates the Constitutional scheme and the dicta of this Court in various \\nearlier decisions already referred to.  It is also important to note that in many \\nTribunals like the National Green Tribunal where earlier removal of members or \\npresiding officer could only be after an enquiry by Supreme Court Judges and with \\nnecessary consultation with the Chief Justice of India, under the present Rules it \\nis permissible for the Central Government to appoint an enquiry committee for \\n95removal of any presiding officer or member on its own.  The Rules are not explicit \\non who would be part of such a Committee and what would be the role of the \\nJudiciary in the process.  In doing so, it significantly weakens the independence of \\nthe Tribunal members.  It is well understood across the world and also under our \\nConstitutional framework that allowing judges to be removed by the Executive is \\npalpably unconstitutional and would make them amenable to the whims of the \\nExecutive, hampering discharge of judicial functions.   \\n170.  In Madras Bar Association (2014) (supra), this Court held that: \\n“…it was acknowledged that Parliament was not precluded from establishing \\na court under a new name to exercise the jurisdiction that was being exercised \\nby members of the  higher judiciary at the time when the Constitution came \\ninto force.  But when that was done, it was critical to ensure that the persons \\nappointed to be members of such a court/tribunal should be appointed in the \\nsame manner and should be entitled to the same security of tenure as the \\nholder of the judicial office at the time when the Constitution came into force.  \\nEven in the treatise Constitutional Law of Canada by Peter W. Hogg, it was \\nobserved: if a province invested a tribunal with a jurisdiction of a kind, which \\nought to properly belong to a Superior,  District or Country Court, then that \\ncourt/tribunal  (created  in  its  place),  whatever  is  its  official  name,  for \\nconstitutional purposes has to, while replacing a Superior, District or Country \\nCourt, satisfy the requirements and standards of the substituted court.  This \\nwould mean that the newly constituted court/tribunal will be deemed to be \\ninvalidly constituted, till its members are appointed in the same manner, and \\ntill its members are entitled to the same conditions of service as were available \\nto the Judges of the court sought to be substituted.” \\n \\n171.   It is essential that the same be observed in letter and spirit and we therefore \\nreiterate that Members and Presiding Officers of Tribunals cannot be removed \\nwithout either the concurrence of the Judiciary or in the manner specified in the \\nConstitution for Constitutional Court judges. \\n (D) Term of Office and Maximum Age \\n172.  Various  enactments  providing  for  appointment  and  other  incidentals  of \\nmembers have been brought to our notice to demonstrate an apparent disparity in \\n96age  of  superannuation  of  Members  and  Chairpersons/Presiding  Officers  of \\ndifferent Tribunals. Illustratively, Section 14D of the Telecom Regulatory Authority \\nof  India  Act,  1997  provides  a  Member  of  Telecom  Disputes  Settlement  and \\nAppellate Tribunal shall not hold office after attaining the age of sixty-five years, \\nwhereas, Section 55(1) of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 provides that a \\nMember of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission shall not hold \\noffice after attaining the age of sixty-seven years. This difference in superannuation \\nage may lead to an undesirable situation wherein a member of a Tribunal with low \\nretirement age can be reappointed in another Tribunal with a higher retirement age.  \\n173.  The Constitution of India doesn’t differentiate between High Courts in terms \\nof conditions of service of judges and prescribes a uniform age of superannuation \\nfor  judges  of  all  High  Courts.  Conforming  to  the  principle,  as  held  in  earlier \\njudgements  of  this  Court,  the  Tribunals  should  have  similar  standards  of \\nappointment  and  service  as  that  of  the  Court  it  is  substituting.  There  must, \\ntherefore, be a uniform age of superannuation for all members in all the Tribunals.  \\n174.  The  only  differentiation  in  age  of  superannuation  provided  by  the \\nConstitution is that between judges of High Courts and Supreme Court. We find \\nthe reason for the same in the intention of the Constituent Assembly which aimed \\nto incorporate the experience and knowledge of a High Court Judge when elevated \\nas  a  Supreme  Court  judge.  Hence,  to  utilise  the  experience  and  knowledge \\nacquired during tenure as a judge of High Court, Supreme Court judges are \\nprovided  with  higher  age  of  superannuation  than  the  judges  of  High  Court. \\nSimilarly, the difference between age of superannuation of Chairman/Presiding \\nOfficer and Member of a Tribunal is because Chairman/Presiding Officer is not a \\n97promotional post and thus cannot be equated with that of the Member. The post of \\nChairman/Presiding Officer requires judicial and administrative experience of at \\nleast that of the judge of a High Court which is evident from the statutes prescribing \\nthem.  \\n175.  Another oddity which was brought to our notice is that there has been an \\nimposition of a short tenure of three years for the members of the Tribunals as \\nenumerated in the Schedule of Tribunals Rules, 2017. A short tenure, coupled with \\nprovision of routine suspensions pending enquiry and lack of immunity thereof \\nincreases the influence and control of the Executive over Members of Tribunals, \\nthus adversely affecting the impartiality of the Tribunals. Furthermore, prescribing \\nsuch short tenures precludes cultivation of adjudicatory experience and is thus \\ninjurious to the efficacy of Tribunals.  \\n176.  This Court criticised the imposition of short tenures of members of Tribunals \\nin Union of India v. Madras Bar Association, (2010) (supra) and a longer tenure \\nwas recommended. It was observed that short tenures also discourage meritorious \\nmembers of Bar to sacrifice their flourishing practice to join a Tribunal as a Member \\nfor a short tenure of merely three years. The tenure of Members of Tribunals as \\nprescribed under the Schedule of the Rules is anti-merit and attempts to create \\nequality between unequals. A tenure of three years may be suitable for a retired \\nJudge of High Court or the Supreme Court or even in case of a judicial officer on \\ndeputation. However, it will be illusory to expect a practising advocate to forego his \\nwell-established practice to serve as a Member of a Tribunal for a period of three \\nyears. The legislature intended to incorporate uniformity in the administration of \\nTribunal  by  virtue  of  Section  184  of  Finance  Act,  2017.  Nevertheless,  such \\n98uniformity cannot be attained at the cost of discouraging meritorious candidates \\nfrom being appointed as Members of Tribunals.  \\n177.  Additionally, the discretion accorded to the Central or State Government to \\nreappoint members after retirement from one Tribunal to another discourages \\npublic faith in justice dispensation system which is akin to loss of one of the key \\nlimbs of the sovereign. Additionally, the short tenure of Members also increases \\ninterference by the Executive jeopardising the independence of judiciary. \\n178.  In the light of the discussion as aforesaid, we hold that the Rules would \\nrequire a second look since the extremely short tenure of the Members of Tribunals \\nis anti-merit and has the effect of discouraging meritorious candidates to accept \\nposts of Judicial Members in Tribunals.  \\n(E) Contradictions in the Rules \\n179.  On  the  contentions  of  parties  and  in  the  light  of  the  aforementioned \\ndiscussion, the Bench has observed following contradictions in the Rules: \\n(a)  There is an inconsistency within the Rules with regard to the tenure \\nprescribed for the Members of Tribunals insofar as a fixed tenure of \\nthree years for both direct appointments from the Bar and appointment \\nof retired judicial officers or judges of High Court or Supreme Court.  It \\nis also discriminatory to the extent that it attempts to create equality \\nbetween unequal classes. The tenure of Members, Vice-Chairman, \\nChairman, etc. must be increased with due consideration to the prior \\ndecisions of the Court.  \\n99(b)  The difference in the age of superannuation of the Members, Vice-\\nChairmen and Chairmen, as formulated in the Rules is contrary to the \\nobjectives of the Finance Act, 2017 viz., to attain uniformity in the \\ncomposition of the Tribunal framework. There should be a uniform age \\nof superannuation for Members, Vice-Chairmen, Chairmen, etc. in all \\nTribunals. \\n(c)  Rule 4(2) of the Rules providing that the Secretary to the Government \\nof India in the Ministry or Department under which the Tribunal is \\nconstituted  shall  be  the  convener  of  the  Search-cum-Selection \\nCommittee, is in direct violation of the doctrine of Separation of Powers \\nand thus contravenes the basic structure of the Constitution. Corollary \\nto  the  dictum  of  this  Court  in  the  Fourth  Judges  Case,  judicial \\ndominance in appointment of members of judiciary cannot be diluted \\nby the Executive.  \\n(d)  Rule 7 accords unwarranted discretion to the Central Government \\ninsofar as it merely directs and not mandates the Central Government \\nto  consider  the  recommendation  of  Committee  for  removal  of  a \\nMember  of  a  Tribunal.  The  Central  Government  shall  mandatorily \\nconsider the recommendation of the Committee before removal of any \\nMember of Tribunal. Furthermore, the proviso to Rule 7 creates an \\nunjust  classification  between  National  Company  Law  Appellate \\nTribunal  (NCLAT)  and  other  fora  inasmuch  as  the  removal  of \\nChairperson or member of NCLAT alone is to be in consultation with \\nthe Chief Justice of India.  \\n100(e)  Moral  turpitude  is  a  term  well  defined  by  this  Court  in  numerous \\ndecisions. Rule 7(b) cannot be allowed to survive as it allows the \\nExecutive to interpret the meaning of ‘moral turpitude’, which is an \\nencroachment on the judicial domain. \\n(f)  The power of relaxation of rules with respect to any class of persons \\nshall be vested with the Search-cum-Selection Committee and not with \\nthe Central Government as provided under Rule 20. As ruled by this \\nCourt earlier in Madras Bar Association (2014) (supra), the Central \\nGovernment cannot be allowed to have administrative control over the \\nJudiciary without subverting the doctrine of separation of powers.  \\nISSUE IV: WHETHER THERE SHOULD BE A SINGLE NODAL AGENCY FOR ADMINISTRATION \\nOF ALL TRIBUNALS? \\n180.  Ld.  Amicus  highlighted  an  apparent  problem  persisting  in  the  current \\nTribunal framework in India. Tribunals established under different Central and \\nState enactments are usually administered by their sponsoring or parent Ministry \\nor concerned department. Thus, when Tribunals or members thereof have to seek \\nfinancial, administrative or any other facility from a department who is also the \\nlitigant before them, their fairness or independence is likely to be compromised. \\nSuch an anomalous situation can only be remedied by the establishment of a single \\nnodal agency, overseeing the entire Tribunal system in the country, bringing all \\nsuch Tribunals to parity. \\n181.  This Court in L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India (supra), envisaged the \\nadministration of the entire Tribunal Framework  in the country to be monitored by \\na single nodal agency/ministry. It was observed not to be advisable to allow \\n101supervision of a Tribunal by a department/ministry which is a party before it. This \\nCourt recommended constitution of an independent agency by the concerned \\nMinistry, to oversee the working of Tribunals. The independent agency when \\nconstituted, may also prescribe a uniform code for appointment, qualification, \\ncondition of service, manner of allocation of fund, etc. of the Tribunals. This will, \\nthe Court suggested, minimise the influence of the parent ministry of the Tribunal, \\nin addition to ensuring uniformity in the entire Tribunal framework. The relevant \\nexcerpt may be reproduced below: \\n“96.  …We  are  of  the  view  that,  until  a  wholly  independent  agency  for  the \\nadministration of all such Tribunals can be set up, it is desirable that all such \\nTribunals should be, as far as possible, under a single nodal ministry which will be \\nin a position to oversee the working of these Tribunals. For a number of reasons \\nthat Ministry should appropriately be the Ministry of Law. It would be open for the \\nMinistry, in its turn, to appoint an independent supervisory body to oversee the \\nworking of the Tribunals. This will ensure that if the President or Chairperson of the \\nTribunal is for some reason unable to take sufficient interest in the working of the \\nTribunal, the entire system will not languish and the ultimate consumer of justice will \\nnot suffer. The creation of a single umbrella organisation will, in our view, remove \\nmany of the ills of the present system. If the need arises, there can be separate \\numbrella organisations at the Central and the State levels. Such a supervisory \\nauthority must try to ensure that the independence of the members of all such \\nTribunals is maintained. To that extent, the procedure for the selection of the \\nmembers  of  the  Tribunals,  the  manner  in  which  funds  are  allocated  for  the \\nfunctioning of the Tribunals and all other consequential details will have to be clearly \\nspelt out.” \\n182.  In Union of India vs. Madras Bar Association (2010) (supra), a five-Judge \\nConstitution Bench of this Court had the opportunity to discuss the Tribunals’ \\nstructure as prevalent in the United Kingdom. It was noted that United Kingdom \\nhas a variety of dispute redressal mechanisms which necessitated constitution of \\nnumerous committees to analyse the functioning of Tribunals. However, this Court \\nprimarily referred to the Leggatt Committee Report, constituted to undertake the \\nreview of delivery of justice through tribunals. After analysing the success story of \\n102Tribunals  in  U.K.,  this  Court  noticed  a  contrast  in  India  and  expressed  its \\ndissatisfaction with respect to the functioning of Tribunals in India, observing: \\n“70. But in India, unfortunately tribunals have not achieved full independence. The \\nSecretary of the “sponsoring department” concerned sits in the Selection Committee \\nfor appointment. When the tribunals are formed, they are mostly dependent on their \\nsponsoring department for funding, infrastructure and even space for functioning. \\nThe statutes constituting tribunals routinely provide for members of civil services \\nfrom the sponsoring departments becoming members of the tribunal and continuing \\ntheir lien with their parent cadre. Unless wide ranging reforms as were implemented \\nin United Kingdom and as were suggested by L. Chandra Kumar are brought about, \\ntribunals in India will not be considered as independent.” \\n183.  This Court had earlier noted the statements of the Ld. Attorney General vide \\norder dated 27 March 2019 in W.P. (C) No. 267/2012, wherein it was submitted \\nthat the Ministry of Law is already overburdened and cannot effectively perform the \\nsupervisory function, as a single nodal Ministry, for all the Tribunals, as was earlier \\nsuggested by this Court.  \\n184.  What appears to be of paramount importance is that every Tribunal must \\nenjoy adequate financial independence for the purpose of its day to day functioning \\nincluding the expenditure to be incurred on (a) recruitment of staff; (b) creation of \\ninfrastructure;  (c)  modernisation  of  infrastructure;  (d)  computerisation;  (e) \\nperquisites  and  other  facilities  admissible  to  the  Presiding  Authority  or  the \\nMembers of such Tribunal. It may not be very crucial as to which Ministry or \\nDepartment performs the duties of Nodal Agency for a Tribunal, but what is of \\nutmost importance is that the Tribunal should not be expected to look towards such \\nNodal Agency for its day to day requirements. There must be a direction to allocate \\nadequate and sufficient funds for each Tribunal to make it self-sufficient and self-\\nsustainable authority for all intents and purposes. The expenditure to be incurred \\non  the  functioning  of  each  Tribunal  has  to  be  necessarily  a  charge  on  the \\n103Consolidated Fund of India.  Therefore, hitherto, the Ministry of Finance shall, in \\nconsultation  with  the  Nodal  Ministry/Department,  shall  earmark  separate  and \\ndedicated funds for the Tribunals. It will not only ensure that the Tribunals are not \\nunder the financial control of the Department, who is a litigant before them, but it \\nmay also enhance the public faith and trust in the mechanism of Tribunals. \\nISSUE  V:  WHETHER  THERE  IS  A  NEED  FOR  CONDUCTING  A  JUDICIAL  IMPACT \\nASSESSMENT OF ALL TRIBUNALS IN INDIA? \\n185.  It was brought to our notice by the Learned Counsel for the petitioner(s) that \\nthere is an imminent need for conducting a Judicial Impact Assessment of all the \\nTribunals  referable  to  the  Finance  Act,  2017.  It  was  argued  that  neither  the \\nLegislature  nor  the Executive  had  conducted  any  assessment  to  analyse the \\nadverse repercussions of the changes brought in the framework of Tribunals in \\nIndia, if any, by the legislative exercises carried out from time to time. \\n186.  The contentions of the petitioner(s) cannot be said to be  unfounded. The \\nthree limbs of the State viz., the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary are \\nso intertwined that there is a direct impact of the action of one limb on another.  \\nEvery  legislation  results  in  an  immediate  increase  in  the  number  of  pending \\nlitigations. It is the responsibility of the other branches of the State to be conscious \\nof the limitations of the Judiciary in keeping pace with increasing pendency of \\nlitigation.  Care has to be taken to ensure that while enhancing the efficacy of \\nlegislations the accrual of resultant litigation is minimal.  \\n104187.  The American principle of ‘Judicial Impact Assessment’ was first borrowed \\nby this Court in its dictum in Salem Advocate Bar Assn. (II) v. Union of India45, \\nwhereby it was observed that it is imperative for the Legislature to perform a \\nJudicial Impact Assessment of the enactment passed to assess its ramifications \\non the judiciary. This Court had directed for a committee to be constituted to assess \\nthe need for Judicial Impact Assessment in the Indian context.  Pursuant thereto \\nthe Jagannadha Rao Committee Report was submitted. The Report suggested that \\nby way of Judicial Impact Assessment, the legislature must analyse the budgetary \\nrequirement  of  the  staff  that  would  require  to  be  created  by  the  statute  and \\nadditional expenditure arising out of the new cases consequent to the enactment. \\nFurther,  the  financial  memorandum,  as  prepared  by  the  legislature,  must \\nspecifically include the number of civil and criminal cases expected to arise from \\nthe new enactment, requirement of more judges and staff for adjudication of these \\ncases and the necessary infrastructure. The requisite paragraphs of the decision \\nin Salem Advocate Bar Assn. (supra) are reproduced as follows: \\n“49. The Committee has also suggested that: \\n“Further, there must be ‘judicial impact assessment’, as done \\nin the United States, whenever any legislation is introduced either \\nin  Parliament  or  in  the  State  Legislatures.  The  financial \\nmemorandum attached to each Bill must estimate not only the \\nbudgetary  requirement  of  other  staff  but  also  the  budgetary \\nrequirement for meeting the expenses of the additional cases that \\nmay arise out of the new Bill when it is passed by the legislature. \\nThe said budget must mention the number of civil and criminal \\ncases likely to be generated by the new Act, how many courts are \\nnecessary, how many judges and staff are necessary and what is \\nthe infrastructure necessary. So far in the last fifty years such \\njudicial  impact  assessment  has  never  been  made  by  any \\nlegislature or by Parliament in our country.” \\n50. Having regard to the constitutional obligation to provide fair, quick and \\nspeedy  justice,  we  direct  the  Central  Government  to  examine  the \\naforesaid  suggestions  and  submit  a  report  to  this  Court  within  four \\nmonths.” \\n \\n45 (2005) 6 SCC 344  \\n105 \\n188.  In the present case, we are of the view that the legislature has not conformed \\nto the opinion of this Court with respect to ‘Judicial Impact Assessment’ and thus, \\nhas not made any attempt to assess the ramifications of the Finance Act, 2017. It \\ncan be legitimately expected that the multifarious amendments in relation to merger \\nand reorganisation of Tribunals may result in massive increase in litigation which, \\nin absence of adequate infrastructure, or budgetary grants, will overburden the \\nJudiciary.  \\n189.  In the fitness of things, we deem it appropriate to direct the Union of India to \\ncarry out financial impact assessment in respect of all the Tribunals referable to \\nSections 158 to 182 of the Finance Act, 2017 and undertake an exercise to assess \\nthe need based requirements and make available sufficient resources for each \\nTribunal established by the Parliament.  \\nISSUE VI: WHETHER JUDGES OF TRIBUNALS SET UP BY ACTS OF PARLIAMENT UNDER \\nARTICLES 323-A AND 323-B OF THE CONSTITUTION CAN BE EQUATED IN ‘RANK’ AND \\n‘STATUS’ WITH CONSTITUTIONAL FUNCTIONARIES? \\n190.  A concerning trend has been brought to the notice of this Court by the \\nLearned Counsels. The Union has, in addition to equal pay and perks, accorded \\nstatus  equivalent  to  that  of  Supreme  Court  and  High  Court  judges  to \\nChairmen/Presidents of various Tribunals and authorities. \\n191.  It is apposite to refer to the ‘Warrant of Precedence’ which delineates the \\nsequential  hierarchy  of  functionaries  which  is  used  most  often  for  formal \\nceremonial arrangements. Such enhancement of the status of certain officials is \\n106sans any rationale and falls squarely outside the Constitutional scheme. Although \\nseemingly  pedantic,  according  status  equivalent  or  higher  than  Constitutional \\nfunctionaries by executive order or by legislation strikes at the essence of the \\nConstitutional dignity and stature accorded to such authorities. The absurdity of the \\nsituation can be demonstrated clearly if tomorrow a bureaucrat is accorded higher \\nstatus than that of a Minister, who is the head of his department.  Such designations \\ndo not have a personal value but rather represent the framework and structure of \\ngovernance envisaged. Illogical changes or altercations hence disturbs the fabric \\nof hierarchy and discipline necessary for the effective functioning of the State.  \\n192.  A similar situation arose in T.N. Seshan vs. Union of India46 wherein the \\nGovernment of India had by ordinance accorded pay and perks equivalent to that \\nof Supreme Court judges to the Chief Election Commissioner.  Consequently, a \\ndemand was made for according rank in the Warrant of Precedence equivalent to \\nthat of Supreme Court judges.  A five-judge bench of this Court held that mere \\nequality in conditions of service to that of a Supreme Court judge cannot confer \\nequal status to such other functionaries. It was noted that: \\n“34. One of the matters to which we must advert is the question of the status of an \\nindividual whose conditions of service are akin to those of the Judges of the \\nSupreme Court. This seems necessary in view of the reliance placed by the CEC \\non this aspect to support his case. In the instant case some of the service conditions \\nof the CEC are akin to those of the Supreme Court Judges, namely, (i) the provision \\nthat he can be removed from office in like manner and on like grounds as a Judge \\nof the Supreme Court and (ii) his conditions of service shall not be varied to his \\ndisadvantage after appointment. So far as the first is concerned instead of repeating \\nthe provisions of Article 124(4), the draftsman has incorporated the same by \\nreference. The second provision is similar to the proviso to Article 125(2). But does \\nthat confer the status of a Supreme Court Judge on the CEC? It appears from the \\nD.O. No. 193/34/92 dated 23-7-1992 addressed to the then Home Secretary, Shri \\nGodbole, the CEC had suggested that the position of the CEC in the Warrant of \\n \\n46 (1995) 4 SCC 611. \\n107Precedence needed reconsideration. This issue he seems to have raised in his letter \\nto the Prime Minister in December 1991. It becomes clear from Shri Godbole\\'s reply \\ndated 25-7-1992, that the CEC desired that he be placed at No. 9 in the Warrant of \\nPrecedence at which position the Judges of the Supreme Court figured. It appears \\nfrom Shri Godbole\\'s reply that the proposal was considered but it was decided to \\nmaintain the CEC\\'s position at No. 11 along with the Comptroller and Auditor \\nGeneral of India and the Attorney General of India. However, during the course of \\nthe hearing of these petitions it was stated that the CEC and the Comptroller and \\nAuditor General of India were thereafter placed at No. 9-A. At our request the \\nlearned Attorney General placed before us the revised Warrant of Precedence \\nwhich did reveal that the CEC had climbed to position No. 9-A along with the \\nComptroller and Auditor General of India. Maintenance of the status of Judges of \\nthe Supreme Court and the High Courts is highly desirable in the national interest. \\nWe mention this because of late we find that even personnel belonging to other fora \\nclaim equation with High Court and Supreme Court Judges merely because certain \\njurisdictions earlier exercised by those Courts are transferred to them not realising \\nthe distinction between constitutional and statutory functionaries. We would like to \\nimpress on the Government that it should not confer equivalence or interfere with \\nthe Warrant of Precedence, if it is likely to affect the position of High Court and \\nSupreme Court Judges, however pressing the demand may be, without first seeking \\nthe views of the Chief Justice of India. We may add that Mr G. Ramaswamy, learned \\ncounsel for the CEC, frankly conceded that the CEC could not legitimately claim to \\nbe equated with Supreme Court Judges. We do hope that the Government will take \\nnote of this and do the needful.” \\n193.  In light of the unequivocal assertions of a co-ordinate bench of this Court, \\nthere can be no doubt that executive action cannot confer status equivalent to that \\nof either Supreme Court or High Court judges on any member or head of any \\nTribunal or other judicial fora.  \\n194.  Furthermore, that even though manned by retired judges of High Courts and \\nthe Supreme Court, such Tribunals established under Article 323-A and 323-B of \\nthe Constitution cannot seek equivalence with High Courts or the Supreme Court.  \\nOnce a judge of a High Court or Supreme Court has retired and he/she no longer \\nenjoys the Constitutional status, the statutory position occupied by him/her cannot \\nbe equated with the previous position as a High Court or a Supreme Court judge.  \\nThe rank, dignity and position of Constitutional judges is hence sui generis and \\narise not merely by their position in the Warrant of Precedence or the salary and \\nperquisites they draw, but as a result of the Constitutional trust accorded in them.  \\n108Indiscriminate accordance of status of such Constitutional judges on Tribunal \\nmembers  and  presiding  officers  will  do  violence  to  the  very  Constitutional \\nScheme47. \\n195.  This Court in L. Chandra Kumar (supra) observed that Tribunals are not \\nsubstitutes of Superior Courts and are only supplemental to them.  Hence, the \\nstatus of members of such Tribunals cannot be equated with that of the sitting \\njudges of Constitutional Courts else, as V.R. Krishna Iyer, J. aptly pointed in his \\narticle titled ‘Why Stultify Judges’ Status?’,  “Creating deemed Justices of High \\nCourts  with  equal  status  and  salaries  suggests  an  oblique  bypassing  of  the \\nConstitution….”.  The relevant extract of L. Chandra Kumar (supra) is reproduced \\nas follows: \\n“93.  Before  moving  on  to  other  aspects,  we  may  summarise  our \\nconclusions on the jurisdictional power of these Tribunals.  The Tribunals \\nare competent to hear matters where the vires of statutory provisions are \\nquestioned.    However,  in  discharging  this  duty,  they  cannot  act  as \\nsubstitutes for the High Courts and the Supreme Court which have, under \\nour  constitutional  set-up,  been  specifically  entrusted  with  such  an \\nobligation.  Their function in this respect is only supplementary and all such \\ndecisions of the Tribunals will be subject to scrutiny before a Division \\nBench of the respective High Courts….”  \\n \\n196.  We would further point out that the Warrant of Precedence is a mere self-\\nserving executive decision and not a law in itself. It is a reflection of the inter-se \\nhierarchy  amongst  functionaries  for  the  purposes  of  discharge  of  important \\nceremonial functions and other State duties. It cannot either confer rights or alter \\nthe status accorded by law. It would further be clearly abhorrent to use such an \\n \\n47 Justice VR Krishna Iyer, “Why Stultify Judges’ Status?”, (2002) 2 LW (JS) 85 (June, 2000) \\n109instrument  to  undermine  the  order  of  precedence  clearly  accorded  under  the \\nConstitution.  \\n197.  It is hence essential that the Union of India, takes note of the observations \\nof this Court herein and abide by the spirit of the Constitution in respecting the \\naforementioned  difference  between  constitutional  functionaries  and  statutory \\nauthorities. It is important for the Union of India to ensure that judges of High Courts \\nand the Supreme Court are kept on a separate pedestal distanced from any other \\nTribunal or quasi-judicial Authority. \\nISSUE VII: WHETHER DIRECT STATUTORY APPEALS FROM TRIBUNALS TO THE SUPREME \\nCOURT OUGHT TO BE DETOURED? \\n198.  During the course of arguments, various facets were highlighted before this \\nCourt, including the soaring pendency of cases and non-adherence of directions \\nof this Court in earlier judgments requiring reconsideration by the legislature of the \\nincreasing trend of providing direct statutory appeals to this Court against orders \\nof Tribunals.  \\n199.  As discussed earlier, Tribunalisation has increased at a rapid pace in the \\npast few decades in our country. Since establishment of the ITAT during the pre-\\nindependence era, the number of tribunals has now increased to several dozens. \\nThe Constitution of India (42nd Amendment) Act, 1976 provided for setting up of \\nAdministrative Tribunals through Article 323A as well as other Tribunals under \\nArticle 323B. These aforementioned provisions in the Constitution were construed \\nby the legislature in a manner resulting in the ousting of jurisdiction of all Courts \\nexcept the Supreme Court under Article 136. Later, in L. Chandrakumar (supra), \\n110this court very aptly held that judicial review by High Courts under Article 226 is a \\npart of the basic structure and hence could not be ousted by any legislation or even \\nConstitutional amendment. Moreover, this Court in L. Chandrakumar (supra) and \\nlater in Madras Bar Association (2014) (supra) and Gujarat Urja Vikas Ltd. \\n(supra) reiterated the urgent need to do away with increasingly common provisions \\nin statutes providing direct statutory appeal to this Court, which as discussed \\nelaborately below poses significant problems in the administration of justice and is \\nalso against the Constitutional scheme. \\n200.  Since the aforesaid issue has not been directly raised by the petitioners and \\nonly a passing reference has been made, it is necessary to delineate whether \\nproviding such appeals to this Court is in consonance with the three-tier Judicial \\nsystem as established under our Constitution.  \\n201.  An examination of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court as envisaged under \\nthe Constitution must be made. Such jurisdiction bestowed upon this Court by the \\nConstitution can be broken into three limbs: appellate, original and advisory. A brief \\ndescription of these jurisdictions is provided below: \\nOriginal jurisdiction: \\n(i)  Writ jurisdiction under Article 32. \\n(ii)  Disputes of election to President/Vice-President under Article 71. \\n(iii)  Inter-state or State-Centre disputes under Article 131. \\n(iv)  Transfer cases under Articles 139 and 139A. \\n(v)  Contempt of Court under Article 145. \\n \\n111Appellate jurisdiction: \\n(i)  Appeals against orders of High Courts with certificate of there being \\nsubstantial constitutional questions under Article 132. \\n(ii)  Appeals against orders of High Courts in civil cases with certificate that \\nthere is substantial question of general importance or that the matter \\nneeds to be decided by the HC under Article 133. \\n(iii)  Appeals against orders of High Courts in criminal cases against award \\nof death penalty in the first instance by the HC, either on appeal or in \\noriginal trial under Article 134. \\n(iv)  All other cases appealable to the Federal Court before commencement \\nof the Constitution under Article 135. \\n(v)  Discretionary power to grant special leave to appeal any order by any \\ncourt or tribunal under Article 136. \\nAdvisory jurisdiction: \\n(i)  Presidential reference under Article 143. \\n(ii)  Reference on removal of Public Service Commission member under \\nArticle 317. \\n202.  The ambit of appellate jurisdiction is clear from a perusal of Articles 132 to \\n136 of the Constitution. Article 132 provides that an appeal may be instituted before \\nthe  Supreme  Court  against  any  order  of  the  High  Court  where  a  substantial \\nquestion of law arises for consideration. Article 133(3) specifies that there shall be \\nno appeal from the order of a single judge of the High Court unless the contrary is \\nprovided through a law by the Parliament. Further, Article 134 delineates the \\n112jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in criminal matters restricting it primarily to cases \\nwhere the High Court has awarded death sentence either in trial before it or in \\nreversal of an earlier acquittal by the trial court. In addition to this, Article 134(2) is \\nlucid in its wording to provide that in absence of any specific legislation by the \\nParliament to enlarge the criminal appellate jurisdiction of this Court, no routine \\nappeal lies before the Supreme Court in criminal matters. The extract from Article \\n134(2) has been reproduced below: \\n“(2) Parliament may by law confer on the Supreme Court any further powers to \\nentertain and hear appeals from any judgment, final order or sentence in a criminal \\nproceeding of a High Court in the territory of India subject to such conditions and \\nlimitations as may be specified in such law.” \\n203.  Article  134(2)  is  successful  in  clarifying  two  things.  Firstly,  there  is  no \\nprovision analogous to Article 134(2) under Article 133 to expand the jurisdiction \\nof the Supreme Court in non-criminal matters. Secondly, Article 134(2) does not \\nencompass matters other than those arising out of criminal proceedings from the \\nHigh Courts.  \\n204.  Presently, there are more than two dozen statutes which provide direct \\nappeals to the Supreme Court from various Tribunals and High Courts. A non-\\nexhaustive list of such Statutes includes:  \\n(i)  Section 35L of the Central Excise Act, 1944 (1 of 1944);  \\n(ii)  Section 116A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (43 of 1951);  \\n(iii)  Section 38 of the Advocates Act, 1961 (25 of 1961);  \\n(iv)  Section  261  of  the  Income  Tax  Act,  1961  (43  of  1961)  before  the \\nestablishment of National Tax Tribunal;  \\n(v)  Section 130E of the Customs Act, 1962 (52 of 1962);  \\n113(vi)  Section 19(1)(b) of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 (70 of 1971);  \\n(vii)  Section 374 and 379 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) \\nread with Section 2 of Supreme Court (Enlargement of Criminal Appellate \\nJurisdiction) Act, 1970 (28 of 1970);  \\n(viii)  Section 23 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (68 of 1986);  \\n(ix)  Section 19 of the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, \\n1987 (28 of 1987);  \\n(x)  Section  10  of  the  Special  Courts  (Trial  of  Offences  relating  to \\nTransactions in Securities) Act, 1992 (27 of 1992);  \\n(xi)  Section 15Z of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (15 \\nof 1992);  \\n(xii)  Section 18 of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Act, 1997 (24 of \\n1997);  \\n(xiii)  Section 53T of the Competition Act, 2002 (12 of 2003);  \\n(xiv)  Section 125 of the Electricity Act, 2003 (36 of 2003);  \\n(xv)  Section 24 of the National Tax Tribunal Act, 2005 (49 of 2005);  \\n(xvi)  Section 30 of the Armed Forces Tribunal Act, 2007 (55 of 2007);  \\n(xvii)  Section 37 of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board Act, 2006 \\n(19 of 2006);  \\n(xviii)  Section 31 of the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India Act, \\n2008 (27 of 2008);  \\n(xix)  Section 22 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 (19 of 2010);  \\n(xx)  Section 423 of the Companies Act, 2013 (18 of 2013);  \\n114(xxi)  Section 38 of the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority \\nAct, 2013 (23 of 2013);  \\n(xxii)  Section 21 of the Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) \\nand Imposition of Tax Act, 2015 (22 of 2015);  \\n(xxiii)  Section 62 and 182 of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (31 of \\n2016); and  \\n(xxiv) Section 118 of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (12 of \\n2017). \\n205.  Such statutory appeals take away the inherent ability of the Supreme Court, \\nas  envisaged  in  the  Constitution,  to  regulate  cases  before  it  by  confining  its \\nconsideration to cases involving the most egregious of wrongs and/or having the \\ngreatest impact on public interest.  \\n \\n206.  Further, in providing for appeals directly from Tribunals, the jurisdiction of \\nHigh Courts is in effect curtailed to a great extent. Not only does this hamper \\naccess to justice, but it also takes away the much needed exposure for High Court \\njudges, earnestly needed in a vibrant and ever-evolving judiciary. Since majority of \\nthe judges of the Supreme Court are elevated from the High Courts, their lack of \\nexposure to these specialised areas of law hinders their efficacy in adjudicating the \\ndirect statutory appeals from specialised Tribunals.  \\n207.  A perusal of the Indian Judiciary: Annual Report 2017-18, published by this \\nCourt shows that pendency in the Supreme Court stands at more than 56,000 \\ncases. Each year this Court hears a humungous volume of cases and disposes of \\napproximately 60,000 - 90,000 cases annually, thus amounting to a staggering \\n1154,000 - 6,000 cases per bench. Out of all the cases instituted before this Court, \\nless  than  2%  is  for  exercise  of  writ  jurisdiction  under  Article  32  whereas  an \\noverwhelming majority of cases are petitions for special leave to appeal under \\nArticle 136.  \\n208.  Although the rate of admission of cases peaked at about 20% in 2011 and \\nhas fallen since then, it is still far above the marginal rate of about 1% in other \\ncomparable jurisdictions such as the Supreme Court of the United States. The \\nmere task of hearing all cases and considering whether to grant leave or not usurps \\na majority of the Court’s time. As a result of frequent invocation of Article 136 by \\nlitigants, the Court is left with hardly any time to discharge its key Constitutional \\nfunctions of deciding substantial Constitutional questions, as envisaged by our \\nfounding fathers. As compared to the early 1960s where Constitution Benches \\ndecided hundreds of cases, the number is no more than a dozen now. Most \\nseminal cases involving major issues of jurisprudence or effecting revolutionary \\nchanges on the legal landscape are by compulsion heard by Division Benches, \\nthus defeating the very objective of Article 145(3). \\n209.  The decrease in propensity of a person with humble means or situated \\nfarther away from the Delhi to approach the Supreme Court is evidence of the fact \\nthat the remedy to approach this Court has been, in effect, limited to only those \\nwith access to ample financial resources. Numerous studies have shown how \\nevery tenth case decided by the High Court of Delhi or every sixteenth case \\ndecided by the High Court of Punjab & Haryana is appealed before this Court, as \\ncompared to a minuscule rate of appeal of a little over 1% against the decision of \\nHigh Court of Madras.  Being an authority entrusted to resolve Constitutional \\n116conflicts or to safeguard the fundamental rights of citizens, this Court cannot afford \\nto provide access only to the affluent. Although it would be futile to examine the \\neffects of such rampant regular appeals, however, it is apparent that it substantially \\naffects the time and quality of judicial determination by this Court. This view had \\nalso been noted in the 272nd Report of the Law Commission wherein it was pointed \\nout that: \\n“3.12. The objective behind establishing the ‘Tribunals’ was to provide an effective \\nand speedier forum for dispensation of justice, but in the wake of routine appeals \\narising from the orders of such forums, certain issues have been raised because \\nsuch appeals are obstructing the constitutional character of the Supreme Court and \\nthus,disturbing the effective working of the Supreme Court as the appeals in these \\ncases do not always involve a question of general public importance. The Supreme \\nCourt is primarily expected to deal with matters of constitutional importance and \\nmatters involving substantial question of law of general public importance. Due to \\noverburdening, the Supreme Court is unable to timely address such matters.” \\n \\n210.  Resultantly,  majority  of  the  matters  involving  significant  Constitutional \\nquestions remain untouched for years; consequently the ability of this Court to keep \\nin check the legislative and executive encroachments is significantly compromised. \\nCases heard by the Constitution Bench comprising of five or more judges have \\nfallen significantly from over 15% in the 1950s to an average of 0.1 - 0.2% during \\nthe  last  two  decades.  Hence,  it  is  clear  that  this  Court  has  been,  in  a  way, \\ntransformed from a Constitutional-Writ Court to a Court of Appeals whereunder \\nmere increase of the number of judges is no more a solution. Whilst the number of \\njudges has increased slightly more than four times, the number of cases since 1950 \\nhas increased more than seventy folds! It is clear that there is a pressing need to \\nrealign the exercise of jurisdiction of this Court and ensure that the Constitutional \\nvision is not defeated. This view has been resonated by this Court since it was \\n117highlighted by Justice P.N. Bhagwati in Bihar Legal Support Authority vs. Chief \\nJustice of India48 in the following manner: \\n“The Supreme Court of India was never intended to be a regular court of appeal \\nagainst orders made by the High Court or the sessions court of the magistrates. It \\nwas created for the purpose of laying down the law for the entire country and the \\nextraordinary jurisdiction of granting special leave was conferred upon it under \\nArticle 136 of the Constitution so that it could interfere whenever it found that the \\nlaw was not correctly enunciated by the lower courts or tribunals and it was \\nnecessary to pronounce the correct law on the subject.” \\n211.  It is evident that this Court has also lost its original character owing to the \\nroutine hearing of appeals through invocation of the discretionary jurisdiction under \\nArticle 136. It is apposite to hold that Article 136 was never meant to be used in \\nthis  manner  as  was  very  aptly  remarked  by  Dr.  B.R.  Ambedkar  before  the \\nConstituent Assembly, who noted that: \\n“The Supreme Court is not likely to grant special leave in any matter whatsoever \\nunless it finds that it involves a serious breach of some principle in the administration \\nof  justice,  or  breach  of  certain  principles  which  strike  at  the  very  root  of \\nadministration of justice as between man and man.” \\n212.  Such self-effacement of this Court’s Constitutional duties requires to be \\nreined in. It is, therefore, essential that this Court judiciously exercise its appellate \\njurisdiction.  For  the  discharge  of  Constitutional  functions  of  deliberating  on \\nsubstantial questions of law, answering Constitutional questions and resolving \\nother issues of great public importance, it is essential that this Court has adequate \\ntime to apply its mind and consider matters in depth. The existing practice of \\nbringing every second case before the SC under Article 136 must be deprecated.  \\n213.  Such a proposed restrictive appellate jurisdiction would mirror the practice \\nof the highest Courts in various other jurisdictions. The Supreme Court of the \\n \\n48 (1986) 4 SCC 767 \\n118United States in the famous case of Marbury vs. Madison49 noted that it was \\nimpermissible for the legislature to expand its original jurisdiction. After examining \\nthe framework of the Constitution of the United States, the Court noted that the \\noriginal jurisdiction of the SC was limited to disputes involving States (as federal \\nunits) and the Union only. Except for that, all other cases can only be brought about \\nin appellate jurisdiction. Although not explicitly stated, such an exercise was felt to \\nbe necessary to check a burgeoning expansion and overloading of the Court’s \\ndocket. \\n214.  Providing statutory appeals directly to the Supreme Court dents this to no \\nend. With increasing tribunalisation, statutory appeal provisions are ostensibly \\nbeing included without undertaking any ‘Judicial Impact Assessment’. As of last \\ncount there are several hundreds of cases which have been decided by the NCLAT \\nand many other thousands by other tribunals pending in this Court.  \\n215.  Note must be taken of the direction this country is heading towards for the \\nsame has a lasting impact on the kind of disputes which arise before this court. No \\nsystem can be made in a vacuum, including our own. With the establishment of \\nmore  tribunals  and  with  increasing  commercialisation  in  line  with  India’s \\ntransformation to an open market liberal economy, the number of these cases is \\nbound to only increase. Unlike routine criminal or civil matters which are tried \\nexclusively before ordinary courts, matters which fall before Tribunals are often \\ncomplex and commercial. \\n \\n49 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803). \\n119216.  In light of this, provisions for statutory appeals directly and liberally to the \\nSupreme Court raises the inevitability of bogging the Court down and inhibiting its \\nConstitutional objective. Further, providing statutory appeals to this Court against \\norders of Tribunals also undermines the essence of tribunalisation. It is hardly \\nrational to state on one hand that an alternate to the ordinary method of justice \\ndispensation needs to be provided owing to the complicated procedures and owing \\nto the lack of specialisation of District and High Courts, and in the same breadth \\nalso provide statutory appeals to the final Court in that very original system.  \\n217.  If High Courts are ill placed to hear routine matters then it hardly seems \\njustifiable that this Court would be any better placed to resolve disputes in appellate \\njurisdiction. Finality as a principle must be encouraged and providing statutory \\nappeals to the Supreme Court only undermines the same. Instead, no discernible \\nharm would arise if decisions of Tribunals or High Courts attain finality, without \\nreaching this Court. \\n218.  A dichotomy in law is further caused by provisions of direct appeal from \\nTribunals to this Court, as noted in the case of  the Armed Forces Tribunals in \\nUnion  of  India  v.  Major  General  Shrikant  Sharma50.  The  two-judge  Bench \\nviewed that: \\n\"Likelihood of anomalous situation \\n42. If the High Court entertains a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of \\nIndia against an order passed by the Armed Forces Tribunal under Section 14 or \\nSection 15 of the Act bypassing the machinery of statute i.e. Sections 30 and 31 of \\nthe Act, there is likelihood of anomalous situation for the aggrieved person in praying \\nfor relief from this Court. \\n43. Section 30 provides for an appeal to this Court subject to leave granted under \\nSection 31 of the Act. By clause (2) of Article 136 of the Constitution of India, the \\n \\n50 (2015) 6 SCC 773. \\n120appellate jurisdiction of this Court under Article 136 has been excluded in relation to \\nany judgment, determination, sentence or order passed or made by any court or \\ntribunal constituted by or under any law relating to the Armed Forces. If any person \\naggrieved by the order of the Tribunal, moves the High Court under Article 226 and \\nthe High Court entertains the petition and passes a judgment or order, the person \\nwho may be aggrieved against both the orders passed by the Armed Forces Tribunal \\nand the High Court, cannot challenge both the orders in one joint appeal. The \\naggrieved person may file leave to appeal under Article 136 of the Constitution \\nagainst the judgment passed by the High Court but in view of the bar of jurisdiction \\nby clause (2) of Article 136, this Court cannot entertain appeal against the order of \\nthe Armed Forces Tribunal. Once, the High Court entertains a petition under Article \\n226 of the Constitution against the order of the Armed Forces Tribunal and decides \\nthe matter, the person who thus approached the High Court, will also be precluded \\nfrom filing an appeal under Section 30 with leave to appeal under Section 31 of the \\nAct against the order of the Armed Forces Tribunal as he cannot challenge the order \\npassed by the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution under Section 30 \\nread with Section 31 of the Act. Thereby, there is a chance of anomalous situation. \\nTherefore, it is always desirable for the High Court to act in terms of the law laid \\ndown by this Court as referred to above, which is binding on the High Court under \\nArticle 141 of the Constitution of India, allowing the aggrieved person to avail the \\nremedy under Section 30 read with Section 31 of the Armed Forces Tribunal Act. \\n44. The High Court (the Delhi High Court) while entertaining the writ petition under \\nArticle 226 of the Constitution bypassed the machinery created under Sections 30 \\nand 31 of the Act. However, we find that the Andhra Pradesh High Court and the \\nAllahabad High Court had not entertained the petitions under Article 226 and \\ndirected the writ petitioners to seek resort under Sections 30 and 31 of the Act. \\nFurther, the law laid down by this Court, as referred to above, being binding on the \\nHigh Court, we are of the view that the Delhi High Court was not justified in \\nentertaining the petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.\" \\n219.  The  seven-judge  Constitution  Bench  in  L.  Chandra  Kumar  (supra) \\nconsidered at great length the permissibility of altering the power of judicial review \\nexercisable by High Courts under Article 226. It authoritatively held that all orders \\npassed by Tribunals which have been established under Article 323A or 323B of \\nthe Constitution, shall be amenable to the writ jurisdiction of High Courts. This \\nCourt, however, in an attempt to respect the intent of facilitating speedy disposal \\nexpressed  by  the  Parliament,  directed  that  such  orders  of  the  Central \\nAdministrative  Tribunals  be  heard  by  a  Division  Bench  of  the  High  Court  if \\nchallenged under Article 226. This Court, thus, held:- \\n\"91. It has also been contended before us that even in dealing with cases which are \\nproperly before the Tribunals, the manner in which justice is dispensed by them \\n121leaves much to be desired. Moreover, the remedy provided in the parent statutes, \\nby way of an appeal by special leave under Article 136 of the Constitution, is too \\ncostly and inaccessible for it to be real and effective. Furthermore, the result of \\nproviding such a remedy is that the docket of the Supreme Court is crowded with \\ndecisions of Tribunals that are challenged on relatively trivial grounds and it is forced \\nto perform the role of a first appellate court. We have already emphasised the \\nnecessity  for  ensuring  that  the  High  Courts  are  able  to  exercise  judicial \\nsuperintendence over the decisions of the Tribunals under Article 227 of the \\nConstitution. In R.K. Jain case [(1993) 4 SCC 119 : 1993 SCC (L&S) 1128 : (1993) \\n25 ATC 464] , after taking note of these facts, it was suggested that the possibility \\nof an appeal from the Tribunal on questions of law to a Division Bench of a High \\nCourt within whose territorial jurisdiction the Tribunal falls, be pursued. It appears \\nthat no follow-up action has been taken pursuant to the suggestion. Such a measure \\nwould have improved matters considerably. Having regard to both the aforestated \\ncontentions, we hold that all decisions of Tribunals, whether created pursuant to \\nArticle 323-A or Article 323-B of the Constitution, will be subject to the High Court\\'s \\nwrit jurisdiction under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution, before a Division Bench \\nof the High Court within whose territorial jurisdiction the particular Tribunal falls.” \\n220.  It is hence clear post L Chandrakumar (supra) that writ jurisdiction under \\nArticle 226 does not limit the powers of High Courts expressly or by implication \\nagainst military or armed forces disputes. The limited ouster made by Article 227(4) \\nonly operates qua administrative supervision by the High Court and not judicial \\nreview. Article 136(2) prohibits direct appeals before the Supreme Court from an \\norder of armed forces tribunals, but would not prohibit an appeal to the Supreme \\nCourt against the judicial review exercised by the High Court under Article 226.  \\n221.  However, it is essential that High Courts use such powers of judicial review \\nrestrictively and on limited grounds, similar to the concept of ‘regulatory deference’ \\nwhich has evolved in the United States. Such a need was also noted by a nine-\\njudge bench in Mafatlal Industries Ltd. vs. Union of India51 which held that: \\n“… While the jurisdiction of the High Courts under Article 226—and of this Court \\nunder Article 32—cannot be circumscribed by the provisions of the said enactments, \\nthey will certainly have due regard to the legislative intent evidenced by the \\nprovisions of the said Acts and would exercise their jurisdiction consistent with the \\nprovisions of the Act. The writ petition will be considered and disposed of in the light \\nof and in accordance with the provisions of Section 11-B. This is for the reason that \\n \\n51 (1997) 5 SCC 536 \\n122the power under Article 226 has to be exercised to effectuate the rule of law and not \\nfor abrogating it.” \\n222.  The jurisdiction under Article 226, being part of the basic structure, can \\nneither be tampered with nor diluted. Instead, it has to be zealously-protected and \\ncannot  be  circumscribed  by  the  provisions  of  any  enactment,  even  if  it  be \\nformulated for expeditious disposal and early finality of disputes. Further, High \\nCourts are conscious enough to understand that such power must be exercised \\nsparingly by them to ensure that they do not become alternate forums of appeal. A \\nfive-judge bench in Sangram Singh v. Election Tribunal52 whilst reiterating that \\njurisdiction under Article 226 could not be ousted, laid down certain guidelines for \\nexercise of such power:  \\n“13. The jurisdiction which Articles 226 and 136 confer entitles the High Courts and \\nthis Court to examine the decisions of all tribunals to see whether they have acted \\nillegally. That jurisdiction cannot be taken away by a legislative device that purports \\nto confer power on a tribunal to act illegally by enacting a statute that its illegal acts \\nshall become legal the moment the tribunal chooses to say they are legal. The \\nlegality of an act or conclusion is something that exists outside and apart from the \\ndecision of an inferior tribunal. It is a part of the law of the land which cannot be \\nfinally determined or altered by any tribunal of limited jurisdiction. The High Courts \\nand the Supreme Court alone can determine what the law of the land is vis-a-vis all \\nother courts and tribunals and they alone can pronounce with authority and finality \\non what is legal and what is not. All that an inferior tribunal can do is to reach a \\ntentative  conclusion  which  is  subject  to  review  under  Articles  226  and  136. \\nTherefore, the jurisdiction of the High Courts under Article 226 with that of the \\nSupreme Court above them remains to its fullest extent despite Section 105.” \\n223.  It  is  apparent  that  the  Legislature  has  not  been  provided  with  desired \\nassistance so that it may rectify the anomalies which arise from provisions of direct \\nappeal to the Supreme Court. Considering that such direct appeals have become \\nserious impediments in the discharge of Constitutional functions by this Court and \\nalso affects access to justice for citizens, it is high time that the Union of India, in \\n \\n52 (1955) 2 SCR 1 \\n123consultation with either the Law Commission or any other expert body, revisit such \\nprovisions under various enactments providing for direct appeals to the Supreme \\nCourt against orders of Tribunals, and instead provide appeals to Division Benches \\nof High Courts, if at all necessary. Doing so would have myriad benefits. In addition \\nto increasing affordability of justice and more effective Constitutional adjudication \\nby this Court, it would also provide an avenue for High Court Judges to keep face \\nwith contemporaneous evolutions in law, and hence enrich them with adequate \\nexperience before they come to this Court. We direct that the Union undertake \\nsuch an exercise expeditiously, preferably within a period of six months at the \\nmaximum, and place the findings before Parliament for appropriate action as may \\nbe deemed fit. \\nISSUE  VIII:  WHETHER  THERE  IS  A  NEED  FOR  AMALGAMATION  OF \\nEXISTING TRIBUNALS AND SETTING UP OF BENCHES \\n224.  While  seeking  a  ‘Judicial  Impact  Assessment’  of  all  existing  Tribunals, \\ncounsels for petitioners/appellant(s) have underscored the exorbitant pendency \\nbefore of a number of Tribunals like the CESTAT and ITAT, which they claim \\naffects the very objective of tribunalisation.  On the other hand, they also highlight \\nan incongruity wherein numerous Tribunals are hardly seized of any matters, and \\nare exclusively situated in one location.   \\n225.  As noted by this court on numerous occasions, including in Madras Bar \\nAssociation (2014) (supra), although it is the prerogative of the Legislature to set \\nup  alternate  avenues  for  dispute  resolution  to  supplement  the  functioning  of \\nexisting  Courts,  it  is  essential  that  such  mechanisms  are  equally  effective, \\n124competent and accessible.  Given that jurisdiction of High Courts and District \\nCourts is affected by the constitution of Tribunals, it is necessary that benches of \\nthe Tribunals be established across the country.  However, owing to the small \\nnumber of cases, many of these Tribunals do not have the critical mass of cases \\nrequired for setting up of multiple benches.  On the other hand, it is evident that \\nother Tribunals are pressed for resources and personnel.  \\n226.  This ‘imbalance’ in distribution of case-load and inconsistencies in nature, \\nlocation and functioning of Tribunals require urgent attention.  It is essential that \\nafter conducting a Judicial Impact Assessment as directed earlier, such ‘niche’ \\nTribunals be amalgamated with others dealing with similar areas of law, to ensure \\neffective utilisation of resources and to facilitate access to justice.  \\n227.  We accordingly direct the Union to rationalise and amalgamate the existing \\nTribunals depending upon their case-load and commonality of subject-matter after \\nconducting a Judicial Impact Assessment, in line with the recommendation of the \\nLaw Commission of India in its 272nd Report.  Additionally, the Union must ensure \\nthat, at the very least, circuit benches of all Tribunals are set up at the seats of all \\nmajor jurisdictional High Courts.   \\nCONCLUSION \\n228.  In light of the above discussions and our analysis, it is held that: \\n(i)  The issue and question of Money Bill, as defined under Article 110(1) of \\nthe Constitution, and certification accorded by the Speaker of the Lok \\nSabha in respect of Part-XIV of the Finance Act, 2017 is referred to a \\nlarger Bench.   \\n125(ii)  Section 184 of the Finance Act, 2017 does not suffer from excessive \\ndelegation of legislative functions as there are adequate principles to \\nguide framing of delegated legislation, which would include the binding \\ndictums of this Court.   \\n(iii)  The Tribunal, Appellate Tribunal and other Authorities (Qualifications, \\nExperience and other Conditions of Service of Members) Rules, 2017 \\nsuffer  from  various  infirmities  as  observed  earlier.  These  Rules \\nformulated by the Central Government under Section 184 of the Finance \\nAct, 2017 being contrary to the parent enactment and the principles \\nenvisaged in the Constitution as interpreted by this Court, are hereby \\nstruck down in entirety.  \\n(iv)  The  Central  Government  is  accordingly  directed  to  re-formulate  the \\nRules  strictly  in  conformity  and  in  accordance  with  the  principles \\ndelineated  by  this  Court  in  R.K.  Jain  (supra),  L.  Chandra  Kumar \\n(supra), Madras Bar Association (supra) and Gujarat Urja Vikas Ltd. \\n(supra) conjointly read with the observations made in the earlier part of \\nthis decision.  \\n(v)  The new set of Rules to be formulated by the Central Government shall \\nensure non-discriminatory and uniform conditions of service, including \\nassured  tenure,  keeping  in  mind  the  fact  that  the  Chairperson  and \\nMembers appointed after retirement and those who are appointed from \\nthe Bar or from other specialised professions/services, constitute two \\nseparate and distinct homogeneous classes. \\n126(vi)  It would be open to the Central Government to provide in the new set of \\nRules that the Presiding Officers or Members of the Statutory Tribunals \\nshall not hold ‘rank’ and ‘status’ equivalent to that of the Judges of the \\nSupreme Court or High Courts, as the case may be, only on the basis of \\ndrawing equal salary or other perquisites. \\n(vii)  There  is  a  need-based  requirement  to  conduct  ‘Judicial  Impact \\nAssessment’ of all the Tribunals referable to the Finance Act, 2017 so as \\nto analyse the ramifications of the changes in the framework of Tribunals \\nas provided under the Finance Act, 2017. Thus, we find it appropriate to \\nissue a writ of mandamus to the Ministry of Law and Justice to carry out \\nsuch ‘Judicial Impact Assessment’ and submit the result of the findings \\nbefore the competent legislative authority.  \\n(viii)  The Central Government in consultation with the Law Commission of \\nIndia or any other expert body shall re-visit the provisions of the statutes \\nreferable to the Finance Act, 2017 or other Acts as listed in para 174 of \\nthis order and place appropriate proposals before the Parliament for \\nconsideration of the need to remove direct appeals to the Supreme Court \\nfrom orders of Tribunals. A decision in this regard by the Union of India \\nshall be taken within six months. \\n(ix)  The  Union  Government  shall  carry  out  an  appropriate  exercise  for \\namalgamation of existing Tribunals adopting the test of homogeneity of \\nthe subject matters to be dealt with and thereafter constitute adequate \\nnumber of Benches commensurate with the existing and anticipated \\nvolume of work.  \\n127INTERIM RELIEF \\n229.  As  the  Tribunal,  Appellate  Tribunal  and  other  Authorities  (Qualification, \\nExperience and other Conditions of Service of Members) Rules, 2017 have been \\nstruck down and several directions have been issued vide the majority judgment \\nfor framing of fresh set of Rules, we, as an interim order, direct that appointments \\nto the Tribunal/Appellate Tribunal and the terms and conditions of appointment \\nshall be in terms of the respective statutes before the enactment of the Finance \\nBill, 2017.  However, liberty is granted to the Union of India to seek modification of \\nthis order after they have framed fresh Rules in accordance with the majority \\njudgment. However, in case any additional benefits concerning the salaries and \\nemoluments have been granted under the Finance Act, they shall not be withdrawn \\nand will be continued. These would equally apply to all new members. \\n230.  The present batch of matters is accordingly disposed of.   \\n231.  Writ Petition (Civil) No. 267 of 2012 is also disposed of in the above terms \\nas the issues arising are similar.  \\n………………………., CJI \\n[RANJAN GOGOI] \\n \\n  \\n………………………….,J \\n[N.V.

Tribunals act as adjudicators of disputes. This movement has in part been \\noccasioned  by  new  legislation  governing  modern  societies  as  they  confront  the \\nchallenges  thrown  up  by  the  complexities  of  social  and  economic  orderings.  The \\nengagement  of  law  with  economics  and  technology  has  been  shaped  by  social, \\ncultural and historical contexts. While many of them may reflect the shared aspirations \\nof societies governed by a common legal tradition, it would be simplistic to assume \\nthat  the  challenges  thrown  up  by  the  layered  adjudication  through  tribunals  are \\ncommon to all societies.  Hence, as we analyse the impact of the growing movement \\ntowards tribunalisation – a feature which is common to all societies – it is important to \\nbear in mind the context in which our problems have arisen as we attempt to find \\nanswers to many of those concerns. Precedents, both judicial and scholarly, in other \\njurisdictions furnish a useful point of reference, so long as we understand that which is \\npeculiarly our own. \\n   \\n \\n \\n4PART A \\nThe old and the new \\n \\n2  Courts  and  tribunals  should  in  theory  be,  but  are  not  always  in  practice, \\ncooperative allies. Tribunals have taken  over the mantle of deciding cases which \\nconventionally were assigned for adjudication to courts.  Litigation, traditionally the \\ndomain of courts, has in incremental stages come to be transferred to the decision-\\nmaking  authority  of  tribunals.  There  is  hence  a  jurisdictional  transfer  of  dispute \\nresolution  to  tribunals.  Accompanied  by  legislative  enactment,  this  postulates  the \\nexclusivity  of  entrustment  to  tribunals.  Then  again,  new  tribunals  have  been \\nconstituted to deal with subject areas of a genre quite distinct from, and therefore, \\nunlike the traditional pattern of litigation with which conventional courts were familiar. \\nTribunals have thus not only taken away subjects which have been carved out of the \\njurisdiction of courts as a matter of legislative policy, but have also fostered a new \\nculture of adjudication over areas in which a traditional court mechanism had little \\nexperience and expertise. In that sense, tribunalisation represents an amalgam of the \\nold and the new: a combination of the role which was traditionally performed by the \\ncourt together with new functional responsibilities, quite unlike the dispute resolution \\nfunction which was traditionally performed by courts. \\n \\nDomain specialisation  \\n \\n3  The movement towards setting up tribunals has been hastened in many parts \\nby the need for specialisation. Specialisation acknowledges the pool of knowledge \\nand domain expertise of persons who discharge core adjudicatory functions within  \\n5PART A \\ntribunals. The assumption which underlies the setting up of tribunals is that those who \\ndecide are individuals possessed of the qualities necessary for adjudication in that \\nspecific field. Acquisition of knowledge prior to appointment to a tribunal and practical \\nexperience of handling subject areas reserved for the tribunal bring together a pool of \\nindividuals possessing the qualifications and abilities to render specialised justice. In \\nfostering  specialisation,  the  tribunal  structure  emphasises  the  specialisation  of \\nadjudicatory personnel. But equally, an important facet is the specialisation of those \\nwho appear before the tribunals. A specialised Bar is an invaluable input towards the \\nefficiency of institutional adjudication. Together, this contributes to an adjudicatory \\nprocess which is cognisant of the special features, needs and requirements of the \\nsubject areas carved for the tribunal. \\n \\n \\n4  The extent to which the purpose of setting up tribunals is realized is often a \\nprojection  of  ground realities.  These  realities,  including  the manner and  extent  to \\nwhich provisions of the law governing a tribunal are enforced, directly impact upon the \\nefficacy of the tribunal. Critical to the purpose of having a specialised tribunal is the \\npresence of specialised adjudicators on decision-making posts. For, it is their domain \\nexpertise  which  defines  the  quality  of  outcomes  in  the  adjudicatory  process. \\nCollectively, the presence of specialised adjudicators depends upon well-trained and \\nqualified persons and their availability in a source pool. This factor has often been lost \\nsight of in the selection of judges to specialised tribunals. Absent the requisite degree \\nof  expertise,  the  procedure  and  functioning  of  the  tribunal  may  only  replicate  a \\nconventional adjudication in a court of law which the tribunal seeks to substitute. \\n6PART A \\nExpedition \\n \\n5  Apart from specialisation, a significant reason for the establishment of tribunals \\nis expedition in the course of justice.  This is also linked to the perceived values \\nimplicit  in  a  specialised adjudicatory process.   Domain  expertise,  particularly in  a \\ncomplex area, is a means of allowing adjudicators who understand the subject to \\ndecide  quickly  and  effectively.  It  is  often  expected  that  the  tribunal  will  follow \\nprocedures which are less cumbersome and tied to forms established in conventional \\ncourts.  By  allowing  for  a  measure  of  procedural  flexibility  coupled  with  domain \\nknowledge, tribunals are expected to remedy some of the causes which burden the \\njudicial system. \\n \\n6  Similarly, another object of the growing need for tribunalisation is to unburden \\nthe court system. That purpose may be subserved when a chunk of existing cases \\npending before the conventional court system are transferred for adjudication to the \\nnewly created body. Reducing the burden on courts is a partial realisation of the \\npurpose underlying the creation of the tribunal. Equally significant is that the tribunal \\nmust possess the ability not to allow, over a period of time, accretions of undisposed \\ncases which had created judicial arrears in the first place. Statistical reduction of \\npending arrears in the judicial system occasioned by the creation of a tribunal has to \\nbe matched by the capacity of the new body to dispose of cases transferred to it from \\nthe court as well as new institutions before it. If this is not achieved, the net result is to \\ndefeat the very purpose of establishing the tribunal. \\n7PART A \\nImpact assessment  \\n \\n7  Our  analysis  above  indicates  that  the  actual  impact  of  the  creation  of  a \\nstructure of tribunals needs to be closely monitored to assess the efficacy of a tribunal \\nas a measure of legal reform. The efficacy of the tribunal is functionally dependent on \\nthe availability of resources and capital, both human and otherwise. The tribunal must \\nbe possessed of adequate infrastructure both in terms of physical availability and the \\ndeployment  of  technological  knowledge  in  the  management  of  litigation.  The \\nprocedures adopted by the tribunal must be flexible enough to allow for decision-\\nmaking effectively and without delay. The process of making appointments to the \\ntribunals must be seamless in order to fill up vacancies arising from retirement or \\nunforeseen  causes.  The  presence  of  large-scale  vacancies  can  render  tribunals \\ndefunct. This defeats the cause of justice in the area of the jurisdiction of the tribunal. \\nThis problem becomes particularly acute where a jurisdiction of a conventional court \\nhas been transferred to the tribunal under the provisions of an operating enactment. \\nAbsent  a  recourse  to  traditional  courts  for  the  resolution  of  conflicts,  a  litigant  is \\nvirtually denied access as a result of an unavailable adjudicator to resolve a dispute. \\nIn other words, the process for appointment and selection has a direct bearing on the \\nefficacy  of  tribunalisation.  Keeping  vacancies  unfilled,  either  as  a  matter  of  tardy \\nprocedures  or for other reasons,  has  the  tendency to  denude  the  efficacy of  the \\ntribunal as a dispute resolution mechanism. The surest way to deny access to justice \\nis to keep a large number of vacancies. \\n \\n \\n8PART A \\nIndependence  \\n8  Above all, the efficacy of tribunalisation rests in the confidence in the process of \\nproviding justice. This is determined by the independence and objectivity of justice \\nproviders. There is a vital societal interest in preserving the sanctity of the process by \\nwhich judges are selected for appointment. The method of selecting and appointing  \\njudges  to  tribunals  determines  in  the  ultimate  analysis,  the  independence  of  the \\ntribunals. Tribunals have been conceived as institutional measures to provide justice \\nin substitution of that provided by conventional courts. Hence, there is a valid reason \\nto ensure the independence of these adjudicating bodies. The process of selection as \\nwell as the terms of appointment is determinative of the ability to attract talent to the \\ntribunals. Hence, in preserving the independence of the tribunals as a facet of judicial \\nindependence,  the  effort  must  be  to  ensure  that  the  adjudicatory  body  is  robust: \\nsubservient to none and accountable to the need to render justice in the context of \\nspecialised adjudication.  \\n \\nA2  A brief history of tribunalisation in India \\n9  Delay and backlog in adjudication of cases was a problem even during the \\ncolonial era.1 The earliest available effort suggesting reforms to handle arrears was \\nthe Justice Rankin Committee report in 1924. Since then, there have been a number  \\nof  expert    body    reports,  including    the  Law  Commission  of  India.  In  India,  the \\nestablishment  of  tribunals  was  done  in  1941  by  the  colonial  government.  Post-\\nIndependence, tribunals were first created in the sphere of tax laws. The original \\n                                                 \\n1 Arun K Thiruvengadam, \\'Tribunals\\' in The Oxford Handbook Of The Indian Constitution (Sujit Choudhry et al eds., \\n(Oxford University Press New York, 2016), pp. 412-31. \\n9PART A \\nConstitution  referred  to  tribunals  only  incidentally  in  Articles  136  and  227,  which \\nspecify that the Supreme Court and the High Courts respectively shall have   power to \\nreview  decisions  of tribunals. The High Court Arrears Committee constituted with \\nJustice  J.  C.  Shah  as  Chairperson  in  1969  recommended  the  constitution  of  an \\nindependent tribunal to handle service matters pending before the High Courts and \\nthe Supreme Court. The Swaran Singh Committee had been constituted by the Union \\nGovernment to recommend changes to the Constitution. Its report released in 1986 \\nrecommended  the setting  up  of tribunals  for  three  broad  subject  areas  to  reduce \\narrears  in    the    Indian    legal  system.  The  report  further  recommended  that  the \\ndecisions of all these tribunals should be subject to the jurisdiction of the Supreme \\nCourt under Article 136 of the Constitution, but should exclude the jurisdiction of all \\nother courts, including writ jurisdiction. \\n \\n \\n10  Consequently,  the  establishment  of  tribunals  in  India  attained  constitutional \\nrecognition  by  the  insertion  of  Articles  323A  and  323B  in  the  Constitution,  which \\ngranted power to  the  Parliament  and  state  legislatures  to  establish  administrative  \\ntribunals  and  tribunals  for  other  matters respectively. \\n \\n11  In pursuance of the power conferred upon it by clause (1) of Article 323A of the \\nConstitution, Parliament enacted the Administrative Tribunals Act 19852 for the setting \\nup of tribunals to deal exclusively with service matters. In S P Sampath Kumar v \\nUnion of India3  (‗Sampath Kumar‘),  the first  challenge  to  the  constitutionality of \\n                                                 \\n2 ―1985 Act‖ \\n3 (1987) 1 SCC 124 \\n10PART A \\ntribunals arose.  This court held that the ‗tribunal should be a real substitute for High \\nCourts — ‗not only in form and de jure but in content and de facto.‘ In this view, \\nalternative  arrangements  have  to  be  effective  and  efficient  as  also  capable  of \\nupholding constitutional limitations. The court held that though judicial review is a \\nbasic  feature  of  the  Constitution,  vesting  of  the  power  of  judicial  review  in  an \\nalternative institutional mechanism would not do violence to the basic structure of the \\nConstitution  so  long  as  it  was  ensured  that  the  alternative  mechanism  was  an \\neffective and real substitute for the High Court. It was also held that a High-Power \\nSelection Committee4 must be constituted with a sitting judge of the Supreme Court \\nnominated  by  the  Chief  Justice  of  India  to  ensure  the  selection  of  competent \\nadjudicators to the tribunals. Upholding the vires of the 1985 Act, the Court suggested \\nseveral amendments to cure the defects with respect to the composition of the tribunal \\nand the mode of appointment of the Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson and members \\nwhich were to be carried out by 31 March, 1987.  \\n \\n12  Decisions subsequent to Sampath Kumar had required a fresh look by a larger \\nBench of this Court over the issues that had been decided. In L Chandra Kumar v \\nUnion of India5 (‗Chandra Kumar‘), a seven judge Bench of this Court revisited the \\nchallenge to the 1985 Act and the power conferred on the Parliament or the state \\nlegislatures by Articles 323A(2)(d) and 323B(3)(d), as the case may be, to exclude the \\njurisdiction of ‗all courts‘, except that of this Court under Article 136 in respect of \\n                                                 \\n4 ―We do not want to say anything about Vice-Chairman and members dealt with in sub-sections (2), (3) or (3-A) \\nbecause so far as their selection is concerned, we are of the view that such selection when it is not of a sitting Judge or \\nretired Judge of a High Court should be done by a high-powered committee with a sitting Judge of the Supreme Court \\nto be nominated by the Chief Justice of India as its Chairman. This will ensure selection of proper and competent \\npeople to man these high offices of trust and help to build up reputation and acceptability.‖ \\n5 (1997) 3 SCC 261  \\n11PART A \\ndisputes referred to in those Articles. Overruling the decision in Sampath Kumar, this \\nCourt drew a distinction between the substitutional role and the supplemental role of \\ntribunals with respect to High Courts and held that the role of tribunals is supplemental \\nin nature. \\n \\n13  Chief  Justice  A  M  Ahmadi  noted  that  the  Constitution  provides  elaborate \\nprovisions dealing with terms of appointments of judges of higher courts. The learned \\njudge  observed  that  the  same  safeguards  are  not  available  to  the  subordinate \\njudiciary  or  members  of  tribunals.  Hence,  they  can  never  be  considered  full  and \\neffective  substitutes  for  the  superior  judiciary  in  discharging  the  function  of \\nconstitutional interpretation : \\n“78…The  constitutional  safeguards  which  ensure  the \\nindependence of the Judges of the superior judiciary, are \\nnot available to the Judges of the subordinate judiciary \\nor  to  those  who  man  tribunals  created  by  ordinary \\nlegislations. Consequently, Judges of the latter category \\ncan never be considered full and effective substitutes for \\nthe  superior  judiciary  in  discharging  the  function  of \\nconstitutional interpretation…” \\n (Emphasis supplied) \\n \\n \\nThe Court struck down Articles 323A(2)(d) and 323B(3)(d) as unconstitutional. It was \\nalso held that an ―exclusion of jurisdiction‖ clause enacted in any legislation, under the \\naegis of Articles 323A(2)(d) and 323B(3)(d) is unconstitutional. \\n \\n \\n14  In  Union  of  India  v  R  Gandhi,  President,  Madras  Bar  Association6  („R \\nGandhi‟), the constitutional validity of Chapters 1-B and 1-C of the Companies Act, \\n                                                 \\n6 (2010) 11 SCC 1 \\n12PART A \\n1956 as inserted by the Companies (Second Amendment) Act 2002 which provided \\nfor the constitution of a National Company Law Tribunal7 and the National Company \\nLaw Appellate Tribunal8 was challenged. Justice R V Raveendran noted that despite \\nthe salient objective behind the constitution of tribunals, ‗full independence‘ had not \\nbeen  achieved  by  them.  The  Court  affirmed  the  view  in  Chandra  Kumar  that  a \\ntribunal may consist of both judicial and technical members. Judicial members ensure \\n‗impartiality, fairness and reasonableness in consideration‘ and technical members \\nensure ‗the availability of expertise and experience related to the field of adjudication‘. \\n \\n15  Though the legislature is empowered to prescribe qualifications for members, \\nthe Court held that superior courts in the country retain their power of judicial review \\nover  the  prescribed  qualifications  to  ensure  that  judicial  functions  are  discharged \\neffectively. The Court surveyed various enactments9 and the qualifications prescribed \\nin them for appointment as judicial and technical members and noted that the ‗speed \\nat which the qualifications for appointment as members is being diluted is, to say the \\nleast, a matter of great concern for the independence of the judiciary.‘ The Court \\ncautioned that tribunals cannot become providers of sinecure to members of civil \\nservices,  by  appointing  them  as  technical  members.  The  Court  emphasised  that \\n‗impartiality, independence, fairness and reasonableness in decision making are the \\nhallmarks of judiciary‘ and laid down the eligibility criteria for judicial and technical \\nmembers.  Taking  note  of  the  recruitment  conditions  for  judicial  and  technical \\nmembers, tenure and service conditions, the Court upheld the creation of the NCLT \\n                                                 \\n7 ―NCLT‖ \\n8 ―NCLAT‖ \\n9 Administrative Tribunals Act 1985, Information Technology Act 2000, Companies Act 1956 as amended (Chapter 1B). \\n13PART A \\nand NCLAT. Several suggestions to amend part 1-B and 1-C were issued, to be \\ncarried out as a condition precedent to ensure that the NCLT and the NCLAT may be \\nmade operational in accordance with the observations made by this Court. \\n \\n16  In Madras Bar Association v Union of India10 (‗Madras Bar Association II‘), \\nthe constitutional validity of the National Tax Tribunal Act 200511 and the Constitution \\n(Forty-Second) Amendment 1976 was challenged on the ground of violating the basic \\nstructure of the Constitution. The National Tax Tribunal12 was vested with the power of \\nadjudicating appeals which included a substantial question of law arising from orders \\npassed by appellate tribunals under specific tax enactments. Prior to the 2005 Act, the \\njurisdiction to adjudicate these appeals lay with the jurisdictional High Court. \\n \\n17  The Court rejected the contention that there was a constitutional mandate for \\nthe appellate jurisdiction pertaining to tax matters to remain with the High Courts, but \\nheld that the members of the Tribunal should be appointed in the same manner and \\nshould be entitled to the same security of tenure as the judges of the Court sought to \\nbe substituted. The Court rejected the challenge based on the separation of powers \\nand proceeded to examine the validity of individual provisions. Section 6 of the Act \\npermitted  accountant  members  or  technical  members  in  the  respective  appellate \\ntribunals to be appointed as members of the NTT. The Court affirmed the position laid \\ndown in Chandra Kumar and R Gandhi that the appointment of technical members is \\n                                                 \\n10 (2014) 10 SCC 1 \\n11 2005 Act \\n12 ―NTT‖ \\n14PART A \\nrestricted to the cases where technical expertise is essential for adjudication and is \\nimpermissible in any other case. Thus, the provision was struck down. \\n \\n18  Section 7 of the 2005 Act provided for the process of selection and appointment \\nof  the  Chairperson  and  members  of  the  NTT.  The  Court  observed  that  as  the \\njurisdiction of the High Courts was being transferred to the Tribunal, the stature of the \\nmembers, conditions of service, and manner of appointment and removal of members \\nmust be akin to that of the judges of High Courts. The selection process included \\nSecretaries of the Departments of the Central Government. The Court struck down \\nthe  section  as  unconstitutional.  Finally,  Section  8  stipulated  that  that  a \\nChairperson/Member who is appointed for an initial duration of five years, is eligible \\nfor reappointment for a further period of five years. Striking down the provision as \\nunconstitutional, the Court held that the provision for reappointment would undermine \\nthe independence of the member who would presumably be constrained to decide \\nmatters in a manner that would ensure their reappointment. The Court noted that \\nsince the NTT had been vested with jurisdiction that earlier vested in the High Courts, \\nall  matters  of  appointment  and  extension  of  tenure  must  be  shielded  from  the \\nexecutive.  The  Court  noted  that  upon  the  declaration  of  numerous  provisions  as \\nunconstitutional,  the  remaining  provisions  were  rendered  ‗otiose  and  worthless‘. \\nHence, the 2005 Act was struck down in its entirety.  \\n \\n \\n15PART A \\n19  Pursuant to the enactment of the Companies Act 2013, a Constitution Bench of \\nthis Court in Madras Bar Association v Union of India13 dealt with the contention \\nthat despite the directions issued in R Gandhi in respect of the provisions concerning \\nthe NCLT and the NCLAT, analogous provisions had been inserted in the 2013 Act \\nwithout complying with those directions. The Court embarked on a comparison of \\nvarious provisions of the Companies Act 2013 with the directions issued in R Gandhi \\nand observed that many discrepancies persisted which were in contravention of the \\ndirections  issued  by  this  Court  in  the  earlier  round  of  litigation  concerning  the \\nqualifications, appointments, eligibility, and composition of the Selection Committees. \\nThe Court affirmed the directions issued in R Gandhi including the direction on the \\ncomposition of the Selection Committee and held that once remedial measures are \\ntaken to bring the provisions in conformity with the directions issued, the NCLT and \\nthe NCLAT may commence operations.  \\n \\n \\nA.3  Shortcomings of the current framework \\n \\n20  Tribunalisation  was  intended  to  combat  the high  pendency  of cases  before \\nIndian Courts. However, experience gained from the working of tribunals suggests \\nthat the efficiency of tribunals in India is significantly reduced due to systemic and \\nadministrative  problems.  The  272nd  Report  of  the  Law  Commission  of  2017  has \\nhighlighted the high level of pendency before the Tribunals. The chart from the report \\nis reproduced below: \\n                                                 \\n13 (2015) 8 SCC 583 \\n16PART A \\n  Tribunal  As On  Number of \\nPending cases \\n1  Central Administrative Tribunal  July, 2017  44,333 \\n2  Railway Claims Tribunal  30.09.2016  45, 604 \\n3  Debt Recovery Tribunal  03.07.2016  78,118 \\n4  Customs, Excise, and Service Tax  End of 2016  90,592 \\nAppeal Tribunal \\n5  Income Tax Appellate Tribunal  End of 2016  91, 538 \\n \\n21  Vidhi  Centre  for  Legal  Policy  in  a  report  titled  ―Reforming  The  Tribunals \\nFramework In India‖ highlights the problems plaguing the tribunal system in India. \\nThese problems have been categorised thus: \\nA)  Lack of independence \\nThe report highlights that in some cases, Ministries are parties before the  tribunals. \\nThe  staff,  finances,  and  administration  are  under  the  control  of  the  Ministry.  The \\nproblem is exacerbated by a revolving door between the bureaucracy and tribunal \\nposts. Therefore, the report states that it is crucial to assess the independence of \\ntribunals  based on the certain parameters including (a) appointment  of  members; b) \\nremoval  of  members;  (c)  reappointments;  (d)  nodal  ministry; and  (e) proclivity to \\nappoint judges/bureaucrats. \\n \\n17PART A \\nB)  Administrative concerns: lack of uniformity in regulation \\nThe  report  notes  that  an  inconsistency  in  qualification  requirements  leads  to \\ndifferences in competencies, maturity and status of members. These inconsistencies \\nare problematic with regard to the growing trend of tribunalisation. Further, the short \\ntenure of members obviates the cultivation of ‗domain expertise‘, which can have an \\nimpact on the efficacy of tribunals. It is also recommended that the age of retirement \\nbe made uniform as uneven tenures hamper institutional continuity. The report notes \\nthe  holding  in  L  Chandra  Kumar  which  criticizes  the  inconsistencies  in  the \\nappointment  process,  qualification  of  members,  age  of  retirement,  resources  and \\ninfrastructure of different tribunals. They can be attributed to tribunals operating under \\ndifferent ministries. The report affirms the observation in the judgment that a single \\nnodal authority or ministry is required for the administration of tribunals in order to \\nimprove efficiency.  \\n \\nC)  Pendency and vacancy in Tribunals \\nThe report notes that the high rate of pendency can be attributed to systemic issues. \\nFor example, the Debt Recovery Tribunal had 58% failed hearings (i.e. avoidable \\nadjournments that were not penalised) and condonations were often granted due to \\ndelays in filing. Such delays accounted for more than half the time taken up by cases. \\nAnother  significant  cause  for  delays  is  absenteeism  of  tribunal  members.\\n  \\n \\n18PART A \\nD)  Jurisdiction of the High Courts \\nProvisions allowing direct appeals to the Supreme Court which by-pass the jurisdiction \\nof High Courts have been examined in multiple cases. Despite  existing precedents \\nand Law Commission of India recommendations, parent statutes of many tribunals  \\nallow  for  a  direct  appeal  to  the  Supreme  Court. Two issues have been noted: \\nFirstly, a direct appeal to the Supreme Court is inaccessible to litigants; and Secondly, \\nsuch a provision leads to congestion of the docket of the Supreme Court. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n19PART B \\nB  The Reference to the Constitution Bench \\n \\n22  At its core, the present reference before the Constitution Bench  raises the \\nissue  of  whether  a  law  which  seeks  to  substitute  existing  statutory  provisions \\ngoverning the appointment, selection and conditions of service of diverse tribunals \\ncan validly be enacted as a Money Bill as a component of the Finance Act. The \\nanswer to this question must in turn depend upon two facets : \\n \\n(i)  Whether judicial review can extend to determining the constitutional validity \\nof a decision of the Speaker of the Upper House to certify the passage of a \\nBill as a Money Bill under Article 110 of the Constitution; and \\n(ii)  Whether the statutory modification of the procedure for appointment and \\nselection of members and their conditions of service is destructive of judicial \\nindependence and hence ultra vires. \\n \\nBetween the universe represented by these two issues, lie the shades of argument \\nupon which the decision of this case will turn. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n20PART C \\nC  Money Bills \\nOrdinary Bills, Money Bills and Financial Bills  \\n23  Conceptually, the Constitution contains a classification of Bills as: (i) Ordinary \\nBills; (ii) Money Bills and (iii) Financial Bills. Bills other than Money Bills and Financial \\nBills can originate in either House of Parliament14. An Ordinary Bill is passed by both \\nthe Houses of Parliament when it has been agreed upon by both the Houses, either \\nwithout amendment or with such amendments as agreed. The President is conferred \\nwith  the  constitutional  authority  to  convene  a  joint  sitting  of  both  the  Houses  of \\nParliament in order to deliberate upon and vote on a Bill which is not a Money Bill15. \\nSpecial provisions are engrafted into the Constitution for the passage of Money Bills. \\nUnlike an Ordinary Bill which can originate in either House of Parliament, a Money Bill \\n                                                 \\n14 Article 107(1) : Subject to the provisions of articles 109 and 117 with respect to Money Bills and other financial Bills, a \\nBill may originate in either House of Parliament. \\n15 Article 108  : (1) If after a Bill has been passed by one House and transmitted to the other House— \\n(a) the Bill is rejected by the other House; or \\n(b) the Houses have finally disagreed as to the amendments to be made in the Bill; or  \\n(c) more than six months elapse from the date of the reception of the Bill by the other House without the \\nBill being passed by it, \\nthe President may, unless the Bill has elapsed by reason of a dissolution of the House of the People, \\nnotify to the Houses by message if they are sitting or by public notification if they are not sitting, his \\nintention to summon them to meet in a joint sitting for the purpose of deliberating and voting on the \\nBill: \\nProvided that nothing in this clause shall apply to a Money Bill. \\n(2) In reckoning any such period of six months as is referred to in clause (1), no account shall be taken of \\nany period during which the House referred to in sub-clause (c) of that clause is prorogued or \\nadjourned for more than four consecutive days. \\n(3) Where the President has under clause (1) notified his intention of summoning the Houses to meet in \\na joint sitting, neither House shall proceed further with the Bill, but the President may at any time \\nafter the date of his notification summon the Houses to meet in a joint sitting for the purpose \\nspecified in the notification and, if he does so, the Houses shall meet accordingly. \\n(4) If at the joint sitting of the two Houses the Bill, with such amendments, if any, as are agreed to in joint sitting, is \\npassed by a majority of the total number of members of both Houses present and voting, it shall be deemed for the \\npurposes of this Constitution to have been passed by both Houses: \\nProvided that at a joint sitting— \\n(a) if the Bill, having been passed by one House, has not been passed by the other House with amendments and \\nreturned to the House in which it originated, no amendment shall be proposed to the Bill other than such \\namendments (if any) as are made necessary by the delay in the passage of the Bill;  \\n(b) if the Bill has been so passed and returned, only such amendments as aforesaid shall be proposed to the Bill and \\nsuch other amendments as are relevant to the matters with respect to which the Houses  have not agreed; \\nand the decision of the person presiding as to the amendments which are admissible under this clause shall be final. \\n(5) A joint sitting may be held under this article and a Bill passed thereat, notwithstanding that a dissolution of the \\nHouse of the People has intervened since the President notified his intention to summon the Houses to meet \\ntherein. \\n21PART C \\ncannot be introduced in the Council of States. Article 109 specifies the procedure for \\nthe passage of a Money Bill. Article 109 reads thus: \\n―109. (1) A Money Bill shall not be introduced in the Council of \\nStates. \\n \\n(2) After a Money Bill has been passed by the House of the \\nPeople it shall be transmitted to the Council of States for its \\nrecommendations and the Council of States shall within a \\nperiod of fourteen days from the date of its receipt of the Bill \\nreturn  the  Bill  to  the  House  of  the  People  with  its \\nrecommendations  and  the  House  of  the  People  may \\nthereupon  either  accept  or  reject  all  or  any  of  the \\nrecommendations of the Council of States. \\n \\n(3)  If  the  House  of  the  People  accepts  any  of  the \\nrecommendations of the Council of States, the Money Bill \\nshall be deemed to have been passed by both Houses with \\nthe amendments recommended by the Council of States and \\naccepted by the House of the People. \\n \\n(4) If the House of the People does not accept any of the \\nrecommendations of the Council of States, the Money Bill \\nshall be deemed to have been passed by both Houses in the \\nform in which it was passed by the House of the People \\nwithout any of the amendments recommended by the Council \\nof States. \\n \\n(5) If a Money Bill passed by the House of the People and \\ntransmitted to the Council of States for its recommendations \\nis not returned to the House of the People within the said \\nperiod of fourteen days, it shall be deemed to have been \\npassed by both Houses at the expiration of the said period in \\nthe form in which it was passed by the House of the People.‖ \\n \\n24  The role of the Rajya Sabha in the passage of Money Bill is restricted. A Money \\nBill can originate only in the Lok Sabha. After it is passed by the Lok Sabha, the Bill is \\ntransmitted  to  the  Rajya  Sabha  for  its  recommendation.  The  Rajya  Sabha  has  a \\nstipulated period of fourteen days to submit the Bill back to the Lok Sabha with its \\nrecommendation.  Recommendations  of  the  Rajya  Sabha  are  of  a  non-binding \\n22PART C \\ncharacter. If the Lok Sabha rejects the recommendations, it is deemed to have been \\npassed by both the Houses in the form in which it was passed by the Lok Sabha \\nwithout the recommendations of the Rajya Sabha. If the Rajya Sabha were not to \\nrespond within the stipulated period of fourteen days, the same consequence would \\nensue. In distinction to the role which is entrusted to the Rajya Sabha in the passage \\nof Ordinary Bills by Article 107, Article 109 confers virtually an overriding authority to \\nthe Lok Sabha in the passage of Money Bills. A Money Bill, unlike an Ordinary Bill, \\ncan only originate in the Lok Sabha. In the passage of a Money Bill, the Rajya Sabha \\nhas thus only a recommendatory role. Ordinary Bills, on the other hand, require the \\nagreement of both the Houses of Parliament to ensure their passage. \\n \\n25  The third category of Bills - Financial Bills, is specified in Article 11716. The \\nreference to Financial Bills is contained in the marginal note to Article 117. Article 117 \\n(1) indicates that a Bill which makes provision for any of the matters specified in \\nclauses  (a)  to  (f)  of  Article  110  (1)  can  be  introduced  or  moved  only  on  the \\nrecommendation of the President and  such a Bill shall not be introduced in the Rajya \\nSabha. The text of Article 117 (1) speaks of Money Bills and other Financial Bills as \\nclasses of Bills which can originate only in the Lok Sabha.  \\n \\n                                                 \\n16 Article 117 : (1) A Bill or amendment making provision for any of the matters specified in sub-clauses (a) to (f) of \\nclause (1) of article 110 shall not be introduced or moved except on the recommendation of the President and a Bill \\nmaking such provision shall not be introduced in the Council of States:  \\n    Provided that no recommendation shall be required under this clause for the moving of an amendment making \\nprovision for the reduction or abolition of any tax.  \\n(2) A Bill or amendment shall not be deemed to make provision for any of the matters aforesaid by reason only that it \\nprovides for the imposition of fines or other pecuniary penalties, or for the demand or payment of fees for licences or \\nfees for services rendered, or by reason that it provides for the imposition, abolition, remission, alteration or regulation \\nof any tax by any local authority or body for local purposes. \\n(3) A Bill which, if enacted and brought into operation, would involve expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India \\nshall not be passed by either House of Parliament unless the President has recommended to that House the \\nconsideration of the Bill. \\n23PART C \\nMoney Bills : Article 110 \\n \\nArticle 110 contains a definition of Money Bills in the following terms : \\n \\n―110. (1) For the purposes of this Chapter, a Bill shall be \\ndeemed  to  be  a  Money  Bill  if  it  contains  only  provisions \\ndealing with all or any of the following matters, namely:—  \\n(a) the imposition, abolition, remission, alteration or regulation \\nof any tax;  \\n(b) the regulation of the borrowing of money or the giving of \\nany guarantee by the Government of India, or the amendment \\nof the law with respect to any financial obligations undertaken \\nor to be undertaken by the Government of India;  \\n(c) the custody of the Consolidated Fund or the Contingency \\nFund of India, the payment of moneys into or the withdrawal \\nof moneys from any such Fund;  \\n(d) the appropriation of moneys out of the Consolidated Fund \\nof India;  \\n(e)  the  declaring  of  any  expenditure  to  be  expenditure \\ncharged on the Consolidated Fund of India or the increasing \\nof the amount of any such expenditure;  \\n(f) the receipt of money on account of the Consolidated Fund \\nof India or the public account of India or the custody or issue \\nof such money or the audit of the accounts of the Union or of \\na State; or  \\n(g) any matter incidental to any of the matters specified in \\nsub-clauses (a) to (f).  \\n \\n(2) A Bill shall not be deemed to be a Money Bill by reason \\nonly  that  it  provides  for  the  imposition  of  fines  or  other \\npecuniary penalties, or for the demand or payment of fees for \\nlicences or fees for services rendered, or by reason that it \\nprovides for the imposition, abolition, remission, alteration or \\nregulation of any tax by any local authority or body for local \\npurposes.  \\n \\n(3) If any question arises whether a Bill is a Money Bill or not, \\nthe  decision  of  the  Speaker  of  the  House  of  the  People \\nthereon shall be final. \\n \\n(4) There shall be endorsed on every Money Bill when it is \\ntransmitted to the Council of States under article 109, and \\nwhen it is presented to the President for assent under article \\n111, the certificate of the Speaker of the House of the People \\nsigned by him that it is a Money Bill.‖ \\n \\n24PART C \\n26  Tracing the origin and evolution of Money Bills, Thomas Erskine May in ―The  \\nTreatise on The Law, Privileges, Proceedings and Usage of Parliament‖17 dwells \\non the relationship between the House of Commons and House of Lords in  Britain in \\nregard to their powers of taxation and on matters of national revenue and public  \\nexpenditure. For nearly three hundred years, the House of Commons was possessed \\nof the legal right to originate grants, but the House of Lords was not precluded from \\namending a Bill. By two resolutions of the Commons in 1671 and 1678, the powers of \\nthe House of Lords were curtailed so as to enable only the Commons to have the sole \\nright  to  direct  or  limit  the  scope  of  a  Bill  regarding  taxation  and  government \\nexpenditure. The House of Lords came to be excluded from altering any such Bill. \\nEven after the enactment of the Standing Order of 1849 which accommodated space \\nto  the  House  of  Lords  to  suggest  amendments  of  legislative  issues,  the  tussle \\nbetween the House of Commons and the House of Lords continued, resulting in the \\npassage of the Parliament Act of 1911. Section 1 defines the power of the House of \\nLords in Money Bills in the following terms : \\n―1. Powers of House of Lords as to Money Bills.—(1) If a \\nMoney Bill, having been passed by the House of Commons, \\nand sent up to the House of Lords at least one month before \\nthe end of the session, is not passed by the House of Lords \\nwithout amendment within one month after it is so sent up to \\nthat House, the Bill shall, unless the House of Commons \\ndirect  to  the  contrary,  be  presented  to  His  Majesty  and \\nbecome  an Act  of Parliament  on  the Royal Assent  being \\nsignified, notwithstanding that the House of Lords have not \\nconsented to the Bill.‖ \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                 \\n17 C. Knight & Company, 1844  \\n   \\n25PART C \\nSection 1(2) defines the expression Money Bill in the following manner : \\n―1. (2) A Money Bill means a Public Bill which in the opinion of \\nthe  Speaker  of  the  House  of  Commons  contains  only \\nprovisions dealing with all or any of the following subjects, \\nnamely,  the  imposition,  repeal,  remission,  alteration,  or \\nregulation of taxation; the imposition for the payment of debt \\nor other financial purposes of charges on the Consolidated \\nFund, the National Loans Fund or on money provided by \\nParliament, or the variation or repeal of any such charges; \\nsupply; the appropriation, receipt, custody, issue or audit of \\naccounts of public money; the raising or guarantee of any \\nloan  or  the  repayment  thereof;  or  subordinate  matters \\nincidental to those subjects or any of them. In this sub-section \\nthe  expressions  ―taxation‖,  ―public  money‖,  and  ―loan‖ \\nrespectively  do  not  include  any  taxation,  money,  or  loan \\nraised by local authorities or bodies for local purposes.‖ \\n \\n27  Two facets of the above definition merit emphasis: the first is the use of the \\nexpression ‗means‘ which indicates that the definition is exhaustive; and second, that \\nthe  content  of  a  Money  Bill  can  have  ―only  provisions‖  dealing  with  the  subjects \\nenunciated in the provision. Under Section 1(3), a Money Bill sent to the House of \\nLords and to Her Majesty for assent should be endorsed with the certificate of the \\nSpeaker of the House of Commons that it is a Money Bill. Section 3 attributes finality \\nto the decision of the Speaker, rendering it immune from judicial review : \\n―3. Certificate of Speaker.—Any certificate of the Speaker of \\nthe  House  of  Commons  given  under  this  Act shall  be \\nconclusive for all purposes, and shall not be questioned in \\nany court of law.‖ \\n(Emphasis supplied) \\n \\nThe Treatise by Erskine May contains the following elaboration of the procedure in \\npassing a Money Bill: \\n―A  ‗Money  Bill‘  which  has  been  passed  by  the  House  of \\nCommons and sent up to the House of Lords at least one \\n26PART C \\nmonth before the end of the session, but is not passed by the \\nHouse of Lords without amendment within one month after it \\nis so sent up, is, unless the House of Commons direct to the \\ncontrary, to be presented for the Royal Assent and becomes \\nan Act of Parliament on the Royal Assent being signified to it. \\nA ‗Money Bill‘, when it is sent up to the House of Lords and \\nwhen it is presented to Her Majesty, must be endorsed with \\nthe Speakers‘ certificate that it is such a bill. Before giving this \\ncertificate the Speaker is directed to consult, if practicable, \\nthose two members of the Panel of Chairs  who are appointed \\nfor  the  purpose  at  the  beginning  of  each  session  by  the \\nCommittee of Selection. \\nWhen the Speaker has certified a bill to be a ‗Money Bill‘ this \\nis recorded in the journal; and Section 3 of the Parliament \\nAct 1911 stipulates such certificate is conclusive for all \\npurposes and may not be questioned in a court of law.   \\nNo  serious  practical  difficulty  normally  arises  in  deciding \\nwhether a particular bill is or is not a ‗Money Bill‘; and criticism \\nhas seldom been voiced of the Speaker‘s action in giving or \\nwithholding a certificate. A bill which contains any of the \\nenumerated matters and nothing besides is indisputably \\na  „Money  Bill‟.  If  it  contains  any  other  matters,  then, \\nunless these are „subordinate matters incidental to‟ and \\nof the enumerated matters so contained in the bill, the \\nbill is not a „Money Bill‟. Furthermore, even if the main \\nobject  of  a  bill  is  to  create  a  new  charge  on  the \\nConsolidated Fund or on money provided by Parliament, \\nthe  bill  will  not  be  certified  if  it  is  apparent  that  the \\nprimary  purpose  of  the  new  charge  is  not  purely \\nfinancial. \\nThe Speaker does not consider the question of certifying a bill \\nuntil it has reached the form in which it will leave the House of \\nCommons, and has declined to give an opinion on whether \\nthe acceptance of a proposed amendment would prevent a \\nbill for being certified as a Money bill. Similarly, in committee \\nthe  chairman  has  declined  to  anticipate  the  Speaker‘s \\ndecision in this matter or to allow the effect of an amendment \\nin this regard to be raised as a point of order.‖    \\n(Emphasis supplied) \\n \\n28  Section 37 of the Government of India Act 1935 contained a special provision \\nfor Financial Bills: \\n―37. Special provisions as to financial Bills.—(1) A Bill or \\namendment making provision— \\n27PART C \\n(a) for imposing or increasing any tax; or \\n(b) for regulating the borrowing of money or the giving of \\nany guarantee by the Federal Government, or for amending \\nthe law with respect to any financial obligations undertaken or \\nto be undertaken by the Federal Government; or \\n(c)  for  declaring  any  expenditure  to  be  expenditure \\ncharged on the revenues of the Federation, or for increasing \\nthe amount of any such expenditure, shall not be introduced \\nor moved except on the recommendation of the Governor-\\nGeneral,  and  a  Bill  making  such  provision  shall  not  be \\nintroduced in the Council of State.‖ \\n \\nAs the Bill could not be introduced or moved ―except on the recommendation of the \\nGovernor General‖, Section 38 authorized each House namely the Council of States \\nand  the  Federal  Assembly  to  make  rules  for  regulating  their  procedure  and  the \\nconduct of business. \\n \\nDuring  the  course  of  the  debates  in  the  Constituent  Assembly,  one  of  the  draft \\namendments moved to Article 90 was the deletion of the expression ―only‖. Explaining \\nthe rationale for moving the proposed amendment, Shri Ghanshyam Singh Gupta \\nstated thus :  \\n―…This article is a prototype of Section 37 of the Government \\nof India Act which says that a Bill or amendment providing for \\nimposing or increasing a tax or borrowing money, etc. shall \\nnot be introduced or moved except on the recommendation of \\nthe governor-General. This means that the whole Bill need \\nnot be a money Bill: it may contain other provisions, but if \\nthere is any provision about taxation or borrowing, etc. It will \\ncome under this Section 37 and the recommendation of the \\nGovernor-General is necessary. Now article 90 says that a \\nBill shall be deemed to be a money Bill if it contains only \\nprovisions dealing with the imposition, regulation, etc., of any \\ntax or the borrowing of money, etc. This can mean that if \\nthere is a Bill which has other provisions and also a provision \\nabout taxation or borrowing etc., it will not become a money \\nBill. If that is the intention I have nothing to say; but that if that \\n28PART C \\nis not the intention I must say the word \"only\" is dangerous, \\nbecause if the Bill does all these things and at the same time \\ndoes something else also it will not be a money Bill. I do not \\nknow what the intention of the Drafting Committee is but I \\nthink this aspect of the article should be borne in mind.‖18 \\n \\n \\nThe amendment was however negatived. \\n \\n29  Article 110 of the Constitution defines a Money Bill for the purposes of the \\nChapter. A Bill is deemed to be a Money Bill ―if it contains only provisions‖ dealing \\nwith any of the matters described in clauses (a) to (g). The word ―only‖ is of crucial \\nsignificance.  The  consequence  of  the  use  of  the  expression  ―only‖  is  to  impart \\nexclusivity. In other words, a Bill will be deemed to be a Money Bill only if it falls within \\nthe description of the matters enunciated in clauses (a) to (g). If the Bill contains \\nmatters which are unrelated to or do not fall within clauses (a) to (g), it is not a Money \\nBill. Article 110 (2) supports this construction since it indicates that a Bill shall not be \\ndeemed to be a Money Bill only for the reason that it provides for: \\n(i)  Imposition of fines or other pecuniary penalties;  \\n(ii)  Demand or payment of fees for licences or fees for services rendered; or  \\n(iii)  The imposition, abolition, remission, alteration or regulation of any tax by \\nany local authority or body for local purposes.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                 \\n18 Constituent Assembly Debates (20 May 1949) \\n29PART C \\n30  This is a clear indicator of the constitutional position that what makes a Bill a \\nMoney Bill for the purposes of Chapter II of Part V of the Constitution is that it deals \\nonly with matters falling under the description provided in clauses (a) to (g) of Article \\n110 (1). Clause (g) of Article 110 (1) covers ―any matter incidental to‖ what is specified \\nin clauses (a) to (f). Clause (g) must not be understood as a residuary provision or a \\ncatch-all-phrase encompassing all other matters which are not specified in clauses (a) \\nto (f). If this construction were to be placed on clause (g), the distinction between an \\nOrdinary  Bill  and  a  Money  Bill  would  vanish.  Hence,  to  be  incidental  within  the \\nmeaning of clause (g), the Bill must cover only those matters which fall within the \\nambit of clauses (a) to (f). It is only a matter which is incidental to any of the matters \\nspecified in clauses (a) to (f) which is contemplated in clause (g). \\nCertification by the Speaker  \\n \\n31  The issue which needs analysis is whether a certification of a Bill as a Money \\nBill by the Speaker is immune from judicial review. Article 110 (3) states that if any \\nquestion arises as to whether a Bill is a Money Bill or not, the decision of the Speaker \\nof  the  House  of  the  People  thereon  shall  be  final.  In  essence,  the  point  for \\nconsideration is whether the finality as stipulated in clause (3) to Article 110 excludes \\njudicial review. \\n \\n32  During the course of the framing of the Constitution, Sir B N Rau, acting as the \\nConstitutional Advisor, prepared a memorandum of the draft Constitution for the Union \\n30PART C \\nConstitution Committee. B Shiva Rao makes a reference to Article 75 of the draft \\nwhich provided that : \\n―if any question arises whether a Bill is a ―Money Bill‖ or not, \\nthe  decision  of  the  Speaker  of  the  House  of  the  People \\nthereon shall be final.‖19   \\n \\nThe draft provision bore a resemblance to Article 22 of the Constitution of Ireland \\n(1937) which provides thus: \\n―1.The  Chairman  of  Dáil  Éireann [Lower  House  in \\nIreland] shall certify any Bill which, in his opinion, is a Money \\nBill to be a Money Bill, and his certificate shall, subject to the \\nsubsequent  provisions  of  this  section,  be  final  and \\nconclusive. \\n2. Seanad Éireann [Upper House in Ireland], by a resolution, \\npassed at a sitting at which not less than thirty members are \\npresent,  may  request  the  President  to  refer  the  question \\nwhether the Bill is or is not a Money Bill to a Committee of \\nPrivileges. \\n3. If the President after consultation with the Council of State \\ndecides  to  accede  to  the  request  he  shall  appoint  a \\nCommittee of Privileges consisting of an equal number of \\nmembers  of  Dáil  Éireann  and  of  Seanad  Éireann  and  a \\nChairman who shall be a Judge of the Supreme Court: these \\nappointments  shall  be  made  after  consultation  with  the \\nCouncil of State. In the case of an equality of votes but not \\notherwise the Chairman shall be entitled to vote. \\n4. The President shall refer the question to the Committee of \\nPrivileges so appointed and the Committee shall report its \\ndecision thereon to the President within twenty-one days after \\nthe day on which the Bill was sent to Seanad Éireann. \\n5. The  decision  of  the  Committee  shall  be  final  and \\nconclusive. \\n6. If the President after consultation with the Council of State \\ndecides not to accede to the request of Seanad Éireann, or if \\nthe Committee of Privileges fails to report within the time \\nhereinbefore specified the certificate of the Chairman of Dáil \\nÉireann shall stand confirmed.‖ \\n(Emphasis supplied) \\n \\n                                                 \\n19  B.  Shiva  Rao, The  Framing  of  India\\'s  Constitution:  Selected  Documents,  Indian  Institution  of  Public \\nAdministration (2012), at p. 32 \\n31PART C \\nThe Irish model contained a provision for resolving a dispute on the certification of a \\nBill as a Money Bill. This part of the dispute resolution procedure was not adopted \\nwhen our Constitution was framed. Moreover, the clause on finality was adopted in a \\nmodified form. Whereas clause (1) of Article 22 of the Irish Constitution uses the \\nexpression ―final and conclusive‖, draft Article 75 provided for the decision  of the \\nSpeaker  of  the  House  of  People  being  final.  On  5  December  1947,  the  Expert \\nCommittee on Financial Provisions suggested an amendment to the draft provision, \\nthe gist of which is indicated by B Shiva Rao :  \\n―When a Money Bill is sent from the Lower House to the \\nUpper, a certificate of the Speaker of the Lower House saying \\nthat it is a Money Bill should be attached to, or endorsed on, \\nthe Bill and a provision to that effect should be made in the \\nConstitution on the lines of the corresponding provision in the \\nParliament  Act,  1911. This  will  prevent  controversies \\nabout the matter outside the Lower House.‖20 \\n(Emphasis supplied) \\n \\n \\nThe extract quoted above is a clear indicator that the purpose of the certification by \\nthe  Speaker  was  to  prevent  controversies  in  the  Upper  House  of  Parliament  by \\nincorporating an element of procedural simplicity. \\n \\nFinal but not conclusive  \\n \\n33   When the draft Article as proposed was accepted and eventually incorporated \\nas  Article  110,  clause  (3)  incorporated  the  principle  of  finality  without  a  specific \\nexclusion of judicial review. Section 3 of the Parliament Act 1911 in Britain specifically \\nexcluded judicial review by providing that a certificate of the Speaker of the House of \\nCommons ―shall be conclusive for all purposes and shall not be questioned in any \\n                                                 \\n20 B. Shiva Rao, The Framing of India\\'s Constitution: Selected Documents, Indian Institution of Public Administration, at \\np. 281. \\n32PART C \\ncourt of law‖. These words imparted both conclusiveness and immunity from judicial \\nreview to the certificate from the Speaker. This language was not adopted in the \\nIndian Constitution. The draftspersons of the Constitution carefully did not incorporate \\nan exclusion from judicial review, in respect of a certificate issued by the Speaker \\nunder clause (3) of Article 110. Finality, in other words, operates as between the \\nUpper and the Lower Houses and does not exclude judicial review by a constitutional \\ncourt. \\n \\n34  The interpretation that we have adopted is supported for yet another reason. In \\ncontexts  where  the  Constitution  intends  to  confer  immunity  from  judicial  review, \\nspecific words to that effect are used. The expression ―shall not be called in question \\nin  any court‖  is,  for instance,  utilized in Article  329  (a), Article  243-O  and  Article \\n243ZG. These Articles read thus: \\n―329. Bar to interference by courts in electoral matters.—\\nNotwithstanding anything in this Constitution— \\n(a)  the  validity  of  any  law  relating  to  the  delimitation  of \\nconstituencies  or  the  allotment  of  seats  to  such \\nconstituencies, made or purporting to be made under Article \\n327 or Article 328, shall not be called in question in any \\ncourt.‖ \\n \\n―243-O.

It \\nwas conceded at the Bar that the effect of this difference in \\nlanguage is that whereas any law made by Parliament under \\nArticle 327, or by the State Legislature under Article 328, \\ncannot exclude the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article \\n226 of the Constitution, that jurisdiction is excluded in regard \\nto matters provided for in Article 329.‖ \\n \\n35  Distinct from the exclusion of judicial review by the above provisions, there are \\nother provisions of the Constitution where a decision is made ―final‖. Finality in such \\ncontexts has been held not to exclude judicial review. Articles 217 (3), 311 (3) and \\nparagraph 6 (1) of the Tenth Schedule use the expression ―final‖ : \\n―217.

He cannot act on the advice of his Ministers. \\nNotwithstanding  the  declared  finality  of  the  order  of  the \\nPresident the Court has jurisdiction in appropriate cases to \\nset  aside  the  order,  if  it  appears  that  it  was  passed  on \\ncollateral considerations or the rules of natural justice were \\nnot observed, or that the President\\'s judgment was coloured \\nby the advice or representation made by the executive or it \\nwas founded on no evidence. … appreciation of evidence is \\nentirely left to the President and it is not for the Courts to hold \\nthat on the evidence placed before the President on which the \\nconclusion is founded, if they were called upon to decide the \\ncase they would have reached some other conclusion.‖ \\n \\n36  In the context of Article 311 (3), a Constitution Bench of this Court in Union of \\nIndia  v  Tulsiram  Patel23  held  that  the  finality  attributed  to  the  decision  of  a \\ndisciplinary authority that it is not reasonably practical to hold an inquiry, does not \\nrender  it  immune  from  judicial  review.  In  Kihoto  Hollohan  v  Zachillhu24,  a \\nConstitution Bench of this Court held that the finality attributed to the decision of the \\nSpeaker of the Lok Sabha or the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha in paragraph 6 (1) of \\nthe Tenth Schedule of the Constitution does not abrogate judicial review : \\n―111. … That Paragraph 6(1) of the Tenth Schedule, to the \\nextent  it  seeks  to  impart  finality  to  the  decision  of  the \\n                                                 \\n22 (1971) 1 SCC 396 \\n23 (1985) 3 SCC 398 \\n24 1992 Supp. (2) SCC 651  \\n35PART C \\nSpeakers/Chairmen  is  valid. But  the  concept  of  statutory \\nfinality  embodied  in  Para  6(1)  does  not  detract  from  or \\nabrogate judicial review under Articles 136, 226 and 227 of \\nthe Constitution insofar as infirmities based on violations of \\nconstitutional  mandates,  mala  fides,  non-compliance  with \\nrules of natural justice and perversity, are concerned.‖ \\n \\nThe Constitution Bench held: \\n \\n―101. … The principle that is applied by the courts is that in \\nspite of a finality clause it is open to the court to examine \\nwhether the action of the authority under challenge is ultra \\nvires the powers conferred on the said authority. Such an \\naction  can  be  ultra  vires  for  the  reason  that  it  is  in \\ncontravention of a mandatory provision of the law conferring \\non the authority the power to take such an action. It will also \\nbe ultra vires the powers conferred on the authority if it is \\nvitiated  by  mala  fides  or  is  colourable  exercise  of  power \\nbased on extraneous and irrelevant considerations….‖ \\n \\nConsequently,  purely  as  a  matter  of  textual  analysis,  the  finality  attributed  to  a \\ncertificate issued by the Speaker under Article 110 (3) does not grant immunity from \\njudicial review.  \\n \\nMatters of procedure and substantive illegalities   \\n \\n37  Article 118 of the Constitution allows each of the Houses of Parliament to make \\nrules  for  regulating  their  procedure  and  the  conduct  of  business,  subject  to  the \\nprovisions of the Constitution. Article 118 provides thus : \\n―118. Rules of procedure.— \\n(1) Each House of Parliament may make rules for regulating, \\nsubject to the provisions of this Constitution, its procedure \\nand the conduct of its business. \\n(2)  Until  rules  are  made  under  clause  (1),  the  rules  of \\nprocedure and standing orders in force immediately before \\nthe commencement of this Constitution with respect to the \\nlegislature  of  the  Dominion  of  India  shall  have  effect  in \\n36PART C \\nrelation  to  Parliament  subject  to  such  modifications  and \\nadaptations as may be made therein by the Chairman of the \\nCouncil of States or the Speaker of the House of the People, \\nas the case may be. \\n(3) The President, after consultation with the Chairman of the \\nCouncil  of  States  and  the  Speaker  of  the  House  of  the \\nPeople, may make rules as to the procedure with respect to \\njoint  sittings  of,  and  communications  between,  the  two \\nHouses. \\n(4) At a joint sitting of the two Houses the Speaker of the \\nHouse of the People, or in his absence such person as may \\nbe determined by rules of procedure made under clause (3), \\nshall preside.‖ \\n \\n \\nArticle 122 of the Constitution provides thus: \\n \\n―122. Courts not to inquire into proceedings of Parliament.—\\n(1) The validity of any proceedings in Parliament shall not be \\ncalled in question on the ground of any alleged irregularity of \\nprocedure. \\n(2) No officer or member of Parliament in whom powers are \\nvested by or under this Constitution for regulating procedure \\nor  the  conduct  of  business,  or  for  maintaining  order,  in \\nParliament shall be subject to the jurisdiction of any court in \\nrespect of the exercise by him of those powers.‖ \\n \\nArticle 122 of the Constitution is similar to Section 41 of the Government of India Act \\n193525. In the Commentary on the Government of India Act 1935 by N Rajagopala \\nAiyangar26, there is an eloquent distinction made between matters of procedure and \\nthose of substance in the context of Section 41 (1): \\n―This  sub-section  seeks  to  cure  defects  arising  from \\nirregularity of procedure in the Legislature. The activities \\nof a chamber may be divided into internal and external, \\nthe  internal  activities  being  the  sphere  of  procedure, \\nwhile  the  external  are  subject  to  the  law  of  the \\n                                                 \\n25 41. – (1) The validity of any proceedings in the Federal Legislature shall not be called in question on the ground of \\nany alleged irregularity of procedure.  \\n(2) No officer or other member of the Legislature in whom powers are vested by or under this Act for regulating \\nprocedure or the conduct of business, or for maintaining order, in the Legislature shall be subject to the jurisdiction of \\nany court in respect of the exercise by him of those powers. \\n26 N Rajagopala Aiyangar, Government of India Act 1935, Madras Law Journal Office (1937) at page 63. \\n37PART C \\nconstitution. It is to irregularities in the domain of the \\nformer class that this sub-section addresses itself. Under \\nthe latter head would fall defects arising from want of \\nlegislative competence, which is a matter external to the \\nassembly and not a matter of procedure.‖   \\n(Emphasis supplied) \\n \\n \\n38  In  the  decision  of  a  Constitution  Bench  in  Babulal  Parate  v  State  of \\nBombay27, this Court noted the distinction between an issue which pertains to the \\nvalidity of proceedings in Parliament and a violation of a constitutional provision.  This \\nwas in the context of the provisions contained in clauses (a) to (e) of Article 3. The \\nConstitution Bench held: \\n―11. It is advisable, perhaps, to add a few more words about \\nArticle 122(1) of the Constitution. Learned counsel for the \\nappellant has posed before us the question as to what would \\nbe the effect of that Article if in any Bill completely unrelated \\nto any of the matters referred to in clauses (a) to (e) of Article \\n3 an amendment was to be proposed and accepted changing \\n(for example) the name of a State. We do not think that we \\nneed answer such a hypothetical question except merely to \\nsay that if an amendment is of such a character that it is not \\nreally an amendment and is clearly violative of Article 3, the \\nquestion  then  will  be  not  the  validity  of  proceedings  in \\nParliament but the violation of a constitutional provision. That, \\nhowever, is not the position in the present case.‖ \\n \\n \\n \\n39  Article 122 (1) provides immunity to proceedings before Parliament being called \\ninto question on the ground of ―any alleged irregularities of procedure‖. In several \\ndecisions  of  this  Court  which  construed  the  provisions  of  Article  122  and  the \\ncorresponding  provisions  contained  in  Article  212  for  the  state  legislatures,  a \\ndistinction has been drawn between an irregularity of procedure and an illegality. \\nImmunity  from  judicial  review  attaches  to  the  former  but  not  to  the  latter.  This \\n                                                 \\n27 (1960) 1 SCR 605 \\n38PART C \\ndistinction found expression in a seven judge Bench decision of this Court in Special \\nReference No. 1 of 196428 (―Special Reference‖). This Court held : \\n―61. … Article 212(2) confers immunity on the officers and \\nmembers of the legislature in whom powers are vested by or \\nunder the Constitution for regulating procedure or the conduct \\nof business, or for maintaining order, in the legislature from \\nbeing subject to the jurisdiction of any court in respect of the \\nexercise by him of those powers. Article 212(1) seems to \\nmake  it  possible  for  a  citizen  to  call  in  question  in  the \\nappropriate Court of law the validity of any proceedings inside \\nthe  Legislative  Chamber  if  his  case  is  that  the  said \\nproceedings suffer not from mere irregularity of procedure, \\nbut from an illegality. If the impugned procedure is illegal \\nand unconstitutional, it would be open to be scrutinised \\nin a Court of law, though such scrutiny is prohibited if \\nthe complaint against the procedure is no more than this \\nthat the procedure was irregular...‖  \\n                                                                  (Emphasis supplied) \\n \\nThis formulation was applied in the context of Article 122 by the Constitution Bench in \\nRamdas Athawale v Union of India29 (―Ramdas Athawale‖): \\n―36.

If \\nthe  impugned  procedure  is  illegal  and  unconstitutional,  it \\nwould be open to be scrutinised in a court of law, though such \\nscrutiny is prohibited if the complaint against the procedure is \\nno more than this that the procedure was irregular. The same \\nprinciple  would  equally  be  applicable  in  the  matter  of \\ninterpretation of Article 122 of the Constitution.‖ \\n \\n \\n                                                 \\n28 Powers, Privileges and Immunities of State Legislatures, In re (Special Reference No. 1 of 1964), AIR 1965 SC 745 \\n29 (2010) 4 SCC 1 \\n39PART C \\nA subsequent Constitution Bench decision in Raja Ram Pal v Hon‟ble Speaker, Lok \\nSabha30 emphasized the distinction between a procedural irregularity and an illegality: \\n―386. … Any attempt to read a limitation into Article 122 so as \\nto  restrict  the  court\\'s  jurisdiction  to  examination  of  the \\nParliament\\'s  procedure  in  case  of  unconstitutionality,  as \\nopposed to illegality would amount to doing violence to the \\nconstitutional text. Applying the principle of ―expressio unius \\nest exclusio alterius‖ (whatever has not been included has by \\nimplication  been  excluded), it  is  plain  and  clear  that \\nprohibition  against  examination  on  the  touchstone  of \\n“irregularity of procedure” does not make taboo judicial \\nreview on findings of illegality or unconstitutionality. \\n*** \\n398. …  the  court  will  decline  to  interfere  if  the  grievance \\nbrought before it is restricted to allegations of ―irregularity of \\nprocedure‖.  But  in  case  gross  illegality  or  violation  of \\nconstitutional  provisions  is  shown,  the  judicial  review \\nwill not be inhibited in any manner by Article 122, or for \\nthat matter by Article 105…‖ \\n                                                                  (Emphasis supplied) \\n \\n \\n40  The fundamental constitutional basis for the distinction between an irregularity \\nof  procedure  and  an  illegality  is  that  unlike  in  the  United  Kingdom  where \\nParliamentary sovereignty governs, India is governed by constitutional supremacy. \\nThe legislative, executive and judicial wings function under the mandate of a written \\nConstitution. The ambit of their powers is defined by the Constitution. The Constitution \\nstructures  the  powers  of  Parliament  and  the  state  legislatures.  Their  authority  is \\nplenary within the field reserved to them. Judicial review is part of the basic structure \\nof  the  Constitution.  Any  exclusion  of  judicial  review  has  to  be  understood  in  the \\ncontext in which it has been mandated under a specific provision of the Constitution. \\nHence the provisions contained in Article 122 which protect an alleged irregularity of \\n                                                 \\n30 (2007) 3 SCC 184 \\n40PART C \\nprocedure  in  the proceedings  in  Parliament  being  questioned  cannot  extend  to  a \\nsubstantive illegality or a violation of a constitutional mandate.  \\n \\n41  Mr K K Venugopal, learned Attorney General for India relied on three decisions \\nin support of his submission that the certificate issued by the Speaker of the Lok \\nSabha that a Bill is a Money Bill is immune from judicial review : \\n(I)  Mangalore  Ganesh  Beedi  Works  v  State  of  Mysore31  (―Mangalore \\nBeedi‖); \\n(II)  Mohd.  Saeed  Siddiqui  v  State  of  Uttar  Pradesh32  (―Mohd.  Saeed \\nSiddiqui‖); and  \\n(III)  Yogendra Kumar Jaiswal v State of Bihar33 (―Yogendra Kumar‖).  \\n \\n \\nMangalore Beedi was a case where a new system of coinage had introduced a naya \\npaisa (one hundred naya paisas being equivalent to a rupee) instead of the erstwhile \\nlegal  tender  of  sixteen  annas  or  sixty-four  pice,  which  continued  to  remain  legal \\ntender. The appellant which was subjected to an additional amount as sales tax due \\nto the change in currency urged that as a result of the substitution of the coinage, \\nthere was a change in tax imposed under the Mysore Sales Tax Act 1948 which could \\nhave been effectuated only by passing a Money Bill under Articles 198, 199 and 207 \\nof the Constitution. Rejecting this submission, the Constitution Bench held that the \\nsubstitution  of  a  new  coinage  did  not  amount  to  an  enhancement  of  tax. \\n                                                 \\n31 AIR 1963 SC 589 \\n32 (2014) 11 SCC 415 \\n33 (2016) 3 SCC 183 \\n41PART C \\nConsequently,  there  was  no  requirement  of  taking  recourse  to  the  provisions  for \\nenacting a Money Bill. However, Justice J L Kapur, speaking for the Court held: \\n―5. … Even assuming that it is a taxing measure its validity \\ncannot be challenged on the ground that it offends Articles \\n197 to 199 and the procedure laid down in Article 202 of the \\nConstitution.  Article  212  prohibits  the  validity  of  any \\nproceedings in a legislature of a State from being called in \\nquestion  on  the  ground  of  any  alleged  irregularity  of \\nprocedure and Article 255 lays down that requirements as to \\nrecommendation and previous sanction are to be regarded as \\nmatters of procedure only.‖ \\n \\n \\n42  The ratio of the decision in Mangalore Beedi is that the substitution of coinage \\ndid  not  amount  to  an  enhancement  of  tax.  Hence,  the  provisions  of  Article  199 \\npertaining to a Money Bill were not attracted. Once that was the finding, it was not \\nnecessary for the decision to rule on whether the certificate of a Speaker under Article \\n199 (3) (corresponding to Article 110 (3)) is immune from judicial review. The ratio of \\nthe decision is that a new coinage does not amount to an enhancement of tax and \\nhence  a  Bill  providing  for  the  substitution  of  coinage  is  not  a  Money  Bill.  The \\nobservations which are extracted above proceed on an assumption, namely that even \\nassuming that it was a taxing measure, its validity could not be challenged on the \\nground  of  an  alleged  irregularity  of  procedure.  This  part  of  the  observations  is \\nevidently not the ratio of Mangalore Beedi. \\n \\n \\n43  Subsequently in Mohd. Saeed Siddiqui, a three judge Bench of this Court \\ndealt with an amendment brought about by the state legislature to a statute governing \\nthe Lokayukta and Up-Lokayukta so as to provide for an extension of the term from \\nsix years to eight years or until the successor enters office. The amendment was \\n42PART C \\nchallenged on the ground that the Bill could not have been introduced as a Money Bill. \\nRelying on the decision in Mangalore Beedi, a three judge Bench held that the issue \\nas to whether a Bill was a Money Bill could only be raised by a Member before the \\nlegislative assembly before it was passed. Chief Justice P Sathasivam, speaking for \\nthe Bench formulated the following principles: \\n―(i) the validity of an Act cannot be challenged on the ground \\nthat it offends Articles 197 to 199 and the procedure laid \\ndown in Article 202; \\n(ii) Article 212 prohibits the validity of any proceedings in a \\nlegislature of a State from being called in question on the \\nground of any alleged irregularity of procedure; and \\n(iii)  Article  255  lays  down  that  the  requirements  as  to \\nrecommendation and previous sanction are to be regarded as \\na matter of procedure only. \\nIt is further held that the validity of the proceedings inside the \\nlegislature of a State cannot be called in question on the \\nallegation that the procedure laid down by the law has not \\nbeen strictly followed and that no court can go into those \\nquestions  which  are  within  the  special  jurisdiction  of  the \\nlegislature itself, which has the power to conduct its own \\nbusiness.‖ \\n \\nThe decision adverted to Article 212 (1) (which corresponds to Article 122(1)) and to \\nArticle 25534 of the Constitution. While the decision also adverted to Raja Ram Pal, \\nthis Court held that any infirmity of procedure was protected by Article 255. \\n \\n \\n44  The subsequent  decision  of  a  two judge  Bench  of  this Court  in  Yogendra \\nKumar dealt with the constitutional validity of the Orissa Special Courts Act 2006, \\nenacted to provide special courts for offences involving the accumulation of properties \\n                                                 \\n34 Article  255 :  No Act of Parliament or of the Legislature of a State  and no provision in any such Act, shall be invalid \\nby reason only that some recommendation or previous sanction required by this Constitution was not given, if assent to \\nthat Act was given— \\n(a) where the recommendation required was that of the Governor, either by the Governor or by the President; \\n(b) where the recommendation required was that of the Rajpramukh, either by the Rajpramukh or by the President; \\n(c) where the recommendation or previous sanction required was that of the President, by the President. \\n43PART C \\ndisproportionate to their known-sources of income by persons who have held or hold \\nhigh political and public offices. Repelling the challenge that the law could not have \\nbeen introduced as a Money Bill in the legislative assembly,  this Court, speaking \\nthrough Justice Dipak Misra (as the than was) held thus: \\n―43. In our considered opinion, the authorities cited by the \\nlearned  counsel  for  the  appellants  do  not  render  much \\nassistance, for the introduction of a Bill, as has been held \\nin Mohd.  Saeed Siddiqui [Mohd.  Saeed Siddiqui v. State  of \\nU.P., (2014) 11 SCC 415] , comes within the concept of \\n―irregularity‖ and it does come with the realm of substantiality. \\nWhat  has  been  held  in Special  Reference  No.  1  of \\n1964 [Powers,  Privileges  and  Immunities  of  State \\nLegislatures, In re (Special Reference No. 1 of 1964), AIR \\n1965 SC 745] has to be appositely understood. The factual \\nmatrix therein was totally different than the case at hand as \\nwe find that the present controversy is wholly covered by the \\npronouncement  in Mohd.  Saeed  Siddiqui and  hence,  we \\nunhesitatingly hold that there is no merit in the submission so \\nassiduously urged by the learned counsel for the appellants.‖ \\n \\n45  The three judge Bench decision in Mohd Saeed Siddiqui relied on Mangalore \\nBeedi as laying down the principle that a certificate of the Speaker that a Bill is a \\nMoney Bill is immune from judicial review. The decision in Mangalore Beedi, as we \\nhave seen, was based on a finding by the Constitution Bench that the substitution of a \\nnew coinage did not constitute an enhancement of tax and hence did not attract the \\nrequirements of a Money Bill. But the three judge Bench decision in Mohd. Saeed \\nSiddiqui also adverts to the provisions of the Article 255 in attributing immunity to the \\ncertificate of the Speaker that a Bill is a Money Bill. Now Article 255 applies in a \\nsituation  where  ―some  recommendation  or  previous  sanction‖  required  by  the \\nConstitution was not given though the Act of Parliament or the legislature of state has \\nsince  received  assent.  Thus,  where  the  recommendation  required  is  that  of  the\\n44PART D \\nGovernor,  the  assent  of  the  President  or  of  the  Governor  and  where  the \\nrecommendation or previous sanction required is that of the President, the assent by \\nthe President will protect the legislation being called into question. The subsequent \\nassent to the law cures the absence of a recommendation, or as the case may be, \\nsanction. Article 255 does not deal with the certificate of the Speaker under Article \\n110 (3) or Article 199 (3), which is neither a recommendation nor a previous sanction \\nwithin the meaning of Article 255. \\n \\n46  Mohd Saeed Siddiqui proceeds on an incorrect construction of the decision in \\nMangalore Beedi and on an erroneous understanding of Article 255. The decision in \\nPandit MSM Sharma v Dr Shree Krishna Sinha35  which was adverted to in Mohd \\nSyed Siddiqui was discussed in the Special Reference to hold that the validity of the \\nproceedings in a legislative chamber can be questioned on the ground of illegality. \\nThe decisions in the Special Reference, Ramdas Athawale  and Raja Ram Pal \\nclearly hold that the validity of the proceedings before Parliament or a state legislature \\ncan be subject to judicial review on the ground of an illegality (as distinguished from \\nan  irregularity  of  procedure)  or  a  constitutional  violation.  Hence,  the  decisions  in \\nMohd Syed Siddiqui and Yogendra Kumar on the above aspect do not lay down the \\ncorrect position in law and are overruled.                     \\n \\n \\nD  Puttaswamy: Judicial review of the certificate of the Speaker \\n47  The Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and \\nServices) Bill 2016 was certified as a Money Bill under Article 110 by the Speaker of \\n                                                 \\n35 AIR 1960  SC 1186 \\n45PART D \\nthe  Lok  Sabha.

The only exception, the majority observed, is \\ncontained in Article 110. As a result, Article 110 being an exception to the scheme of \\nbicameralism had to be given a ―strict construction‖41. The majority held thus: \\n \\n―463. The  Rajya  Sabha,  therefore,  becomes  an  important \\ninstitution signifying constitutional federalism. It is precisely \\nfor this reason that to enact any statute, the Bill has to be \\npassed by both the Houses, namely, Lok Sabha as well as \\nRajya  Sabha.  It  is  the  constitutional  mandate.  The  only \\nexception to the aforesaid Parliamentary norm is Article 110 \\nof  the  Constitution  of  India.  Having  regard  to  this  overall \\nscheme of bicameralism enshrined in our Constitution, strict \\ninterpretation has to be accorded to Article 110. Keeping in \\nview  these  principles,  we  have  considered  the arguments \\nadvanced by both the sides.‖ \\n \\n                                                 \\n36 (2019) 1 SCC 1 (―Puttaswamy‖) \\n37 Puttaswamy at para 462  \\n38 (2006) 7 SCC 1 \\n39 Puttaswamy at para 463 \\n40 Puttaswamy at para 463 \\n41 Puttaswamy at para 463 \\n46PART D \\n \\nThe  above  extract  clearly  indicates  that  the  arguments  were  considered  on  the \\ntouchstone of the requirement that for a Bill to be a Money Bill, strict adherence to the \\nprovisions of Article 110 is necessary. \\n \\n49  On the issue of justiciability42 Justice Sikri rejected specifically the submissions \\nurged on behalf of the Union of India that the certification of the Speaker was not \\nsubject to judicial review.

Union of India (Supra) \\n455.5.Kihoto Hollohan v.

In the view of the majority, Section 7 \\nwhich makes the receipt of a subsidy, benefit or service conditional on the identity of \\nthe recipient being established by the process of authentication under Aadhaar was \\nreferable to Article 110 since these financial benefits were ―extended with the support \\n                                                 \\n42 Puttaswamy at para 455 \\n47PART D \\nof the Consolidated Fund of India‖43.  The provisions of Section 23(2)(h) and Section \\n54 were held to be incidental to the main provision and covered by Article 110(g). \\nSection 57, which permitted the use of Aadhaar by private entities for other purposes, \\nwas held to be unconstitutional. Having thus analysed the provisions of the Bill, the \\nmajority held: \\n―472. For all the aforesaid reasons, we are of the opinion \\nthat Bill was rightly introduced as Money Bill. Accordingly, it \\nis not necessary for us to deal with other contentions of \\nthe  petitioners,  namely,  whether  certification  by  the \\nSpeaker about the Bill being Money Bill is subject to \\njudicial review or not, whether a provision which does not \\nrelate to Money Bill is severable or not. We reiterate that \\nmain provision is a part of Money Bill and other are only \\nincidental and, therefore, covered by clause (g) of Article 110 \\nof the Constitution.‖  \\n(Emphasis supplied). \\n \\n50  Both Mr Arvind Datar, learned amicus curiae and the learned Attorney General \\nfor  India  have  highlighted  the  apparent  inconsistency  among  the  observations \\ncontained in paragraphs 463, 464 and 472 of the judgment.  For, paragraph 464 \\nrejects  the  submissions  of  the  Union  of  India  that  the  Speaker‘s  decision  is  not \\njusticiable in the aftermath of the earlier discussion that Article 110 must receive a \\nstrict construction, while para 472 holds that it was not necessary for the majority to \\ndeal with whether certification by the Speaker  of a Bill as a Money Bill is subject to \\njudicial review.  However, in the course of the conclusion in paragraph 515, the issue \\nto which answers were framed was: \\n―515.(6). Whether  the  Aadhaar  Act  could  be  passed  as \\n―Money  Bill‖  within  the  meaning  of  Article  110  of  the \\nConstitution?‖ \\n \\n                                                 \\n43 Puttaswamy at para 466 \\n48PART D \\nThe answer in paragraph 515.1 is in the following terms: \\n―515.1. We  do  recognise  the  importance  of  Rajya  Sabha \\n(Upper House) in a bicameral system of the Parliament. The \\nsignificance and relevance of the Upper House has been \\nsuccinctly  exemplified  by  this  Court  in Kuldip  Nayar‘s \\ncase [Kuldip Nayar v. Union of India, (2006) 7 SCC 1]. The \\nRajya  Sabha,  therefore,  becomes  an  important  institution \\nsignifying  constitutional  federalism.  It  is  precisely  for  this \\nreason that to enact any statute, the Bill has to be passed by \\nboth the Houses, namely, Lok Sabha as well as Rajya Sabha. \\nIt is the constitutional mandate. The only exception to the \\naforesaid  Parliamentary  norm  is  Article  110  of  the \\nConstitution of India. Having regard to this overall scheme of \\nbicameralism  enshrined  in  our  Constitution,  strict \\ninterpretation has to be accorded to Article 110. Keeping in \\nview  these  principles,  we  have  considered  the arguments \\nadvanced by both the sides.‖ \\n \\n51  On merits, Section 7 was held to be a core provision, satisfying the conditions \\nof Article 110 while the others were held to be incidental in nature.  Section 57 had \\nbeen held to be unconstitutional.  Hence the conclusion was in the following terms: \\n―467…Section 7 is the core provision of the Aadhaar Act and \\nthis provision satisfies the conditions of Article 110 of the \\nConstitution. Upto this stage, there is no quarrel between the \\nparties. \\n515.5. On examining of the other provisions pointed out by \\nthe petitioners in an attempt to take it out of the purview of \\nMoney  Bill,  we  are  of  the  view  that  those  provisions  are \\nincidental in nature which have been made in the proper \\nworking of the Act. In any case, a part of Section 57 has \\nalready been declared unconstitutional. We, thus, hold that \\nthe Aadhaar Act is validly passed as a ‗Money Bill‘. \\n \\n52  A holistic reading of the decision of the majority would indicate that: (i) Article \\n110 has been construed to be an exception to the principle of bicameralism and, \\ntherefore, the provision must (it has been held) receive strict interpretation; (ii) Section \\n7 constituted the core provision of the Aadhaar Bill which was referable to Article 110 \\n49PART D \\nwhile  the  other  provisions  were  incidental;  and  (iii)  Section  57  was    held  to  be \\nunconstitutional in so far as it allowed the use of the Aadhaar platform by private \\nentities including corporate bodies. The observations in para 472 cannot, therefore, be \\nconstrued  to  mean  that  the  majority  desisted  from  expressing  a  final  view  on \\njusticiability. \\n \\n53  The judgment of Justice DY Chandrachud specifically holds that the decision of \\nthe Speaker to certify a Bill as a Money Bill is not immune from judicial review.  After \\ntracing  the  constitutional  history  of  Article  110  including  the  provisions  of  the \\nParliament Act 1911 in Britain and Section 37 of the Government of India Act 1935, \\nthe judgment places reliance on the construction placed on the provisions of Article \\n122  and  the  corresponding  provision  in  Article  212  in  (i)  Special  Reference;  (ii) \\nRamdas Athawale ; and (iii) Raja Ram Pal. In coming to the conclusion that the \\ndecision of the Speaker is amenable to judicial review if it suffers from illegality or from \\na violation of constitutional provisions, the decisions in Mohd Saeed Siddiqui and \\nYogendra  Kumar  Jaiswal  were  disapproved.  Distinguishing  the  principle  of \\nParliamentary sovereignty in the UK from the position of constitutional supremacy in \\nIndia, the decision observes: \\n―1067. The  purpose  of  judicial  review  is  to  ensure  that \\nconstitutional  principles  prevail  in  interpretation  and \\ngovernance.  Institutions  created  by  the  Constitution  are \\nsubject  to  its  norms.  No  constitutional  institution  wields \\nabsolute  power.  No  immunity  has  been  attached  to  the \\ncertificate  of  the  Speaker  of  the  Lok  Sabha  from  judicial \\nreview,  for  this  reason.  The  Constitution  makers  have \\nenvisaged a role for the judiciary as the expounder of the \\nConstitution.  The  provisions  relating  to  the  judiciary, \\nparticularly those regarding the power of judicial review, were \\nframed,  as  Granville  Austin  observed,  with  ―idealism‖ \\n[Granville Austin, The Indian Constitution: Cornerstone of a \\n50PART D \\nNation, Oxford University Press (1966), at p. 205.]  Courts of \\nthe  country  are  expected  to  function  as  guardians  of  the \\nConstitution and its values. Constitutional courts have been \\nentrusted with the duty to scrutinise the exercise of power by \\npublic  functionaries  under  the  Constitution.  No  individual \\nholding an institutional office created by the Constitution can \\nact  contrary  to  constitutional  parameters.  Judicial  review \\nprotects  the  principles  and  the  spirit  of  the  Constitution. \\nJudicial  review  is  intended  as  a  check  against  arbitrary \\nconduct of individuals holding constitutional posts. It holds \\npublic functionaries accountable to constitutional duties. If our \\nConstitution  has  to  survive  the  vicissitudes  of  political \\naggrandisement and to face up to the prevailing cynicism \\nabout  all  constitutional  institutions,  notions  of  power  and \\nauthority must give way to duties and compliance with the \\nrule of law. Constitutional institutions cannot be seen as focal \\npoints for the accumulation of power and privilege. They are \\nheld in trust by all those who occupy them for the moment. \\nThe impermanence of power is a sombre reflection for those \\nwho occupy constitutional offices. The Constitution does not \\ncontemplate a debasement of the institutions which it creates. \\nThe office of the Speaker of the House of People, can be no \\nexception. The decision of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha in \\ncertifying a Bill as a Money Bill is liable to be tested upon the \\ntouchstone  of  its  compliance  with  constitutional  principles. \\nNor  can  such  a  decision  of  the  Speaker  take  leave  of \\nconstitutional morality.‖ \\n \\n54  Justice  Ashok  Bhushan,  in  his  separate  opinion,  specifically  held  that  the \\ndecision of the Speaker in certifying a Bill as a Money Bill is capable of judicial review. \\nThe learned judge held thus: \\n―901. We  have  noticed  the  Constitution  Bench  judgments \\nin Kihoto Hollohan [Kihoto Hollohan v. Zachillhu, 1992 Supp \\n(2) SCC 651] and Raja Ram Pal [Raja Ram Pal v. Lok Sabha, \\n(2007) 3 SCC 184] that finality of the decision of the Speaker \\nis not immuned from Judicial Review. All Bills are required to \\nbe passed by both Houses of Parliament. Exception is given \\nin case of Money Bills and in the case of joint sitting of both \\nHouses.  In  event,  we  accept  the  submission  of  learned \\nAttorney General that certification by Speaker is only a matter \\nof procedure and cannot be questioned by virtue of Article \\n122(1),  any  Bill,  which  does  not  fulfil  the  essential \\nconstitutional condition under Article 110 can be certified as \\nMoney Bill by-passing the Upper House. There is a clear \\ndifference  between  the  subject  “irregularity  of \\nprocedure” and “substantive illegality”. When a Bill does \\nnot  fulfil  the  essential  constitutional  condition  under \\n51PART D \\nArticle 110(1), the said requirement cannot be said to be \\nevaporated only on certification by Speaker. Accepting \\nthe submission that certification immunes the challenge \\non  the  ground  of  not  fulfilling  the  constitutional \\ncondition,  Court  will  be  permitting  constitutional \\nprovisions to be ignored and by-passed. We, thus, are of \\nthe view that decision of the Speaker certifying the Bill as \\nMoney Bill is not only a matter of procedure and in event, \\nany  illegality  has  occurred  in  the  decision  and  the \\ndecision  is  clearly  in  breach  of  the  constitutional \\nprovisions, the decision is subject to Judicial Review. We \\nare,  therefore,  of  the  view  that  the  Three  Judge  Bench \\njudgment of this Court in Mohd. Saeed Siddiqui [Mohd. Saeed \\nSiddiqui v. State of U.P., (2014) 11 SCC 415] and Two Judge \\nBench  judgment  of  this  Court  in Yogendra  Kumar \\nJaiswal [Yogendra Kumar Jaiswal v. State of Bihar, (2016) 3 \\nSCC 183 : (2016) 2 SCC (Cri) 1] do not lay down the correct \\nlaw. We, thus, conclude that the decision of the Speaker \\ncertifying the Aadhaar Bill as Money Bill is not immuned from \\nJudicial Review.‖ \\n(Emphasis supplied)\\nJustice Ashok Bhushan then held on merits that the Bill had been correctly passed as \\na Money Bill. \\n \\n55  From the above analysis, it is evident that the judgments of both Justice D Y \\nChandrachud and Justice Ashok Bhushan categorically held that the decision of the \\nSpeaker to certify a Bill as a Money Bill is not immune from judicial review. There is a \\nclear  distinction  between  an  irregularity  of  procedure  under  Article  122(1)  and  a \\nsubstantive  illegality.  The  certificate  of  the  Speaker  under  Article  110(3)  is  not \\nconclusive in so far as judicial review is concerned. Judicial review can determine \\nwhether the conditions requisite for a Bill to be validly passed as a Money Bill were \\nfulfilled. The point of difference between the majority (represented by the decisions of \\nJustice  Sikri  and  Justice  Ashok  Bhushan)  and  Justice  Chandrachud  was  that  on \\nmerits, the majority came to the conclusion that the Aadhaar Bill is a Money Bill within \\nthe meaning of Article 110(1) while the dissent held otherwise. \\n52PART E \\n56  On an overall reading of the judgment of Justice Sikri, it is not possible to \\naccede  to  the  submission  of  the  learned  Attorney  General  that  the  issue  of  the \\nreviewability of the certificate of the Speaker is left at large by the decision of the \\nmajority.  In any event, in view of the issue having arisen in the present case, we have \\ndealt with the aspect of judicial review independently of the decision in Puttaswamy. \\n \\nE  Role of the Rajya Sabha \\n57  The Rajya Sabha consists of not more than two hundred and fifty members, \\ntwelve nominated by the President (from persons with special knowledge or practical \\nexperience  in  literature,  science,  art  and  social  service)  and  not  more  than  two \\nhundred and thirty eight representatives of the States and Union Territories44. The \\nFourth Schedule specifies the manner in which allocation of seats is made in the \\nRajya Sabha.  The elected members of the legislative assembly of every state elect \\nthe representatives of the state in the Rajya Sabha in accordance with ―the system of \\nproportional representation by means of the single transferable vote‖.  Representation \\nof the Union Territories is provided by a law enacted by Parliament. \\n \\n                                                 \\n4480 (1) The Council of States] shall consist of—  \\n(a) twelve members to be nominated by the President in accordance with the provisions of clause (3); and  \\n(b) not more than two hundred and thirty-eight representatives of the States 3[and of the Union territories.]  \\n(2) The allocation of seats in the Council of States to be filled by representatives of the States and of the Union \\nterritories] shall be in accordance with the provisions in that behalf contained in the Fourth Schedule.  \\n(3) The members to be nominated by the President under sub-clause (a) of clause (1) shall consist of persons having \\nspecial knowledge or practical experience in respect of such matters as the following, namely:- \\nLiterature, science, art and social service.  \\n(4) The representatives of each State in the Council of States shall be elected by the elected members of the \\nLegislative Assembly of the State in accordance with the system of proportional representation by means of the single \\ntransferable vote.  \\n(5) The representatives of the [Union territories] in the Council of States shall be chosen in such manner as Parliament \\nmay by law prescribe. \\n53PART E \\n58  The Rajya Sabha, unlike the Lok Sabha, is not subject to dissolution but one-\\nthird of its members retire by rotation45.  The Lok Sabha, unless sooner dissolved, has \\na life span of five years. In contrast, the Constitution envisages that the Rajya Sabha \\nis an institution possessed of constitutional continuity with a third of its members \\nretiring by rotation at stipulated intervals. In line with the principle of constitutional \\ncontinuity, Article 107(4) stipulates that a Bill which is pending in the Rajya Sabha \\nwhich has not been passed by the Lok Sabha shall not lapse on the dissolution of the \\nLok Sabha. On the other hand, under Clause (5), a Bill which is pending in the Lok \\nSabha or upon being passed by the Lok Sabha is pending in the Rajya Sabha, shall \\nlapse on a dissolution of the Lok Sabha, subject to Article 10846. The role of the Rajya \\nSabha in respect of Money Bills has, however, been substantially curtailed. Money \\nBills can originate only in the Lok Sabha. Moreover, the Rajya Sabha has only a \\nrecommendatory power, as noticed earlier, in regard to Money Bills. \\nBicameralism  \\n \\n59  Bicameralism emerged in 14th century Britain. The House of Lords represented \\na chamber where a debate took place with feudal lords, while the House of Commons \\nwas where citizens were represented. The House of Lords comprised of hereditary \\npeers while the House of Commons in their historical origin comprised of persons \\npossessed of property as required.  Across the Atlantic, the Constitution of the United \\n                                                 \\n45 83. (1) The Council of States shall not be subject to dissolution, but as nearly as possible one-third of the members \\nthereof shall retire as soon as may be on the expiration of every second year in accordance with the provisions made in \\nthat behalf by Parliament by law. \\n(2) The House of the People, unless sooner dissolved, shall continue for 1[five years] from the date appointed for its \\nfirst meeting and no longer and the expiration of the said period of 1[five years] shall operate as a dissolution of the \\nHouse:  \\nProvided that the said period may, while a Proclamation of Emergency is in operation, be extended by Parliament by \\nlaw for a period not exceeding one year at a time and not extending in any case beyond a period of six months after the \\nProclamation has ceased to operate. \\n46 Article 108 contains provisions for a joint sitting of two Houses of Parliament. \\n54PART E \\nStates adopted bicameralism. The Constitutional Convention of 1787 represented a \\nconstitutional compromise where the House of Representatives comprised of directly \\nelected legislatures, each voter possessed of an equal vote in the elections and the \\nSenate,  where  each  state  could  send  two  members  elected  indirectly.    In  the \\nFederalist Papers, James Madison underscored the importance of the Senate as an \\nindirectly elected Upper House of a bicameral legislature: \\n―First …  a  senate,  as  a  second  branch  of  the  legislative \\nassembly, distinct from, and dividing the power with, a first, \\nmust be in all cases a salutary check on the government. It \\ndoubles  the  security  to  the  people,  by  requiring  the \\nconcurrence of two distinct bodies in schemes of usurpation \\nor perfidy, where the ambition or corruption of one would \\notherwise be sufficient. … \\nSecond: The necessity of a senate is not less indicated by the \\npropensity of all single and numerous assemblies to yield to \\nthe  impulse  of  sudden  and  violent  passions,  and  to  be \\nseduced by factious leaders into intemperate and pernicious \\nresolutions. … \\nThird: Another defect to be supplied by a senate lies in a want \\nof  due  acquaintance  with  the  objects  and  principles  of \\nlegislation. It is not possible that an assembly of men called \\nfor the most part from pursuits of a private nature, continued \\nin appointment for a short time, and led by no permanent \\nmotive to devote the intervals of public occupation to a study \\nof the laws, the affairs, and the comprehensive interests of \\ntheir country, should, if left wholly to themselves, escape a \\nvariety of important errors in the exercise of their legislative \\ntrust. …  \\nA good government implies two things: first, fidelity to the \\nobject of government, which is the happiness of the people; \\nsecondly, a knowledge of the means by which that object can \\nbe best attained. … \\nFourth: The mutability in the public councils arising from a \\nrapid succession of new members, however qualified they \\nmay be, points out, in the strongest manner, the necessity of \\nsome stable institution in the government.‖  \\n \\n \\n \\n55PART E \\n60  Madison conceived of the Senate as a body which imposes a salutary check on \\ngovernment. To Madison, the requirement of concurrence of two legislative bodies \\nensured against usurpation of public power. The Senate was conceived of as a body \\ncapable of calm deliberation, isolated from the governing passions of the day. As a \\nsobering voice, the Senate, it was conceived would reflect an expertise in framing \\nlegislation. It was an institution which symbolises stability in constitutional governance. \\nHM  Seervai  in  his  classical  text,  Constitutional  Law  of  India47  emphasises  the \\nposition of the Rajya Sabha as a critical ingredient in the federal structure: \\n―First and foremost, Parliament (the Central Legislature) is \\ndependent upon the States, because one of its Houses, the \\nCouncil of States, is elected by the Legislative Assemblies of \\nthe States. Where the ruling party, or group of parties, in the \\nHouse of the People has a majority but not an overwhelming \\nmajority, the Council of States can have a very important \\nvoice in the passage of legislation other than financial Bills. \\nSecondly, a Bill to amend the Constitution requires to be \\npassed  by  each  House  of  Parliament  separately  by  an \\nabsolute majority in that House and by not less than two-\\nthirds of those present and voting. Since the Council of States \\nis  indirectly  elected  by  the  State  Legislatures,  the  State \\nLegislatures have an important say in the amendment of the \\nConstitution because of the requirement of special majorities \\nin each House. Thirdly, the very important matters mentioned \\nin the proviso to Article 368 (Amendment of the Constitution) \\ncannot  be  amended  unless  the  amendments  passed  by \\nParliament are ratified by not less than half the number of \\nLegislatures  of  the States  …  Fourthly,  the  amendment  of \\nArticle  352  by  the  44th  Amendment  gives  the  Council  of \\nStates  a  most  important  voice  in  the  declaration  of \\nEmergency, because a proclamation of emergency must be \\napproved by each House separately by majorities required for \\nan amendment of the Constitution … Fifthly, the executive \\npower of the Union is vested in the President of India who is \\nnot  directly  elected  by  the  people  but  is  elected  by  an \\nelectoral college consisting of (a) the elected Members of the \\nLegislative  Assemblies  of  the  States,  and  (b)  the  elected \\nmembers of both Houses of Parliament … Directly the State \\nLegislatures  have  substantial  voting  power  in  electing  the \\n                                                 \\n47 HM Seervai, Constitutional Law of India, Universal Law Co Pvt Ltd, Vol I, (1991), at pp.299-300 \\n56PART E \\nPresident;  that  power  is  increased  indirectly  through  the \\nCouncil  of  States,  which  is  elected  by  the  Legislative \\nAssemblies of States.‖  \\n \\n61  The Rajya Sabha Secretariat has, in its publication titled ―Second Chamber in \\nIndian Parliament: Role and Studies of Rajya Sabha‖, emphasised the position of the \\nRajya Sabha as an institution sensitive to the aspirations of the states, contributing in \\nthat  capacity  to  strengthening  the  federal  structure  of  the  nation.  The  publication \\nemphasises some of the special powers possessed by the Rajya Sabha: \\n―(i) Article 249 of the Constitution provides that Rajya Sabha \\nmay pass a resolution, by a majority of not less than two-\\nthirds of the Members present and voting to the effect that it is \\nnecessary or expedient in the national interest that Parliament \\nshould make a law with respect to any matter enumerated in \\nthe State List. Then, Parliament is empowered to make a law \\non the subject specified in the resolution for the whole or any \\npart of the territory of India. Such a resolution remains in force \\nfor a maximum period of one year but this period can be \\nextended  by  one  year  at  a  time  by  passing  a  further \\nresolution; \\n(ii)  Under  Article  312  of  the  Constitution,  if  Rajya  Sabha \\npasses a resolution by a majority of not less than two-thirds of \\nthe Members present and voting declaring that it is necessary \\nor expedient in the national interest to create one or more All \\nIndia  Services  common  to  the  Union  and  the  States, \\nParliament has the power to create by law such services; and \\n(iii) Under the Constitution, the President is empowered to \\nissue  Proclamations  in  the  event  of  national  emergency \\n(Article 352), in the event of failure of constitutional machinery \\nin a State (Article 356), or in the case of financial emergency \\n(Article 360). Normally, every such Proclamation has to be \\napproved by both Houses of Parliament within a stipulated \\nperiod. Under certain circumstances, however, Rajya Sabha \\nenjoys special powers in this regard. If a Proclamation is \\nissued at a time when the dissolution of the Lok Sabha takes \\nplace  within  the  period  allowed  for  its  approval,  then  the \\nProclamation can remain effective if a resolution approving it, \\nis passed by Rajya Sabha.‖ \\n   \\n \\n \\n57PART E \\n62  In Kuldip Nayar, Chief Justice Y K Sabharwal speaking for the Constitution \\nBench emphasised the role of the Rajya Sabha in the following observations: \\n―47. The Rajya Sabha is a forum to which experienced public \\nfigures get access without going through the din and bustle of \\na general election which is inevitable in the case of the Lok \\nSabha. It acts as a revising chamber over the Lok Sabha. The \\nexistence of two debating chambers means that all proposals \\nand programmes of the Government are discussed twice. As \\na revising chamber, the Rajya Sabha helps in improving Bills \\npassed by the Lok Sabha.‖ \\n \\nThe significance of the role of the Rajya Sabha was also emphasised by Justice A K \\nSikri  (writing  on  behalf  of  himself  and  two  other  judges)  in  Puttaswamy. \\nComplementing those observations, the judgment of Justice DY Chandrachud places \\nthe position of the Rajya Sabha, in the context of federalism being a part of the basic \\nfeatures of the Constitution: \\n―1106. The  institutional  structure  of  the  Rajya  Sabha  has \\nbeen developed to reflect the pluralism of the nation and its \\ndiversity of language, culture, perception and interest. The \\nRajya  Sabha  was  envisaged  by  the  makers  of  the \\nConstitution  to  ensure  a  wider  scrutiny  of  legislative \\nproposals. As a second chamber of Parliament, it acts as a \\ncheck  on  hasty  and  ill-conceived  legislation,  providing  an \\nopportunity for scrutiny of legislative business. The role of the \\nRajya Sabha is intrinsic to ensuring executive accountability \\nand to preserving a balance of power. The Upper Chamber \\ncomplements the working of the Lower Chamber in many \\nways. The Rajya Sabha acts as an institution of balance in \\nrelation to the Lok Sabha and represents the federal structure \\n[ In S.R. Bommai v. Union of India, (1994) 3 SCC 1 : AIR \\n1994 SC 1998] of India. Both the existence and the role of the \\nRajya Sabha constitute a part of the basic structure of the \\nConstitution. The architecture of our Constitution envisions \\nthe Rajya Sabha as an institution of federa bicameralism and \\nnot  just  as  a  part  of  a  simple  bicameral  legislature.  Its \\nnomenclature  as  the  ―Council  of  States‖  rather  than  the \\n―Senate‖ appropriately justifies its federal importance.‖ \\n \\n58PART E \\n63  Bicameral legislatures have a significant constitutional role particularly in the \\ncontext  of  federal  structures.  The  Rajya  Sabha,  as  our  Constitution  emphasises, \\nrepresents  the  aspirations  of  the  states  and  is  hence  a  critical  element  in  the \\nconstitutional  design  of  the  federal  structure.  The  Rajya  Sabha  is  an  institution \\npossessed of constitutional continuity.  The body is not dissolved like the House of the \\nPeople and its members retire by rotation. The exclusion of the Rajya Sabha has \\nbeen contemplated in the context of Money Bills. However, this is an exception to the \\noverarching principle that Bills have to be passed by both Houses of Parliament. \\n \\n64  There is a significant difference between the provisions of Article 110(1) which \\ndefines Money Bills and the provisions of Article 117(1) which enunciates special \\nprovisions  as  to  Financial  Bills.  Article  117(1)  provides  that  a  Bill  or  amendment \\nmaking provision for any of the matters specified in sub-clauses (a) to (f) of Article \\n110(1)  shall  not  be  introduced  or  moved  except  on  the  recommendation  of  the \\nPresident of India and the Bill making such provision shall not be introduced in the \\nCouncil of States.  The word ‗only‘ which is employed in Article 110(1) in the definition \\nof Money Bills is absent in Article 117(1). The Legislative Procedure in the Rajya \\nSabha48 explains that Financial Bills are comprised in categories I and II respectively: \\n―b. Financial Bills – Category-I \\nA Bill falling under clause (1) of article 117 of the Constitution \\nis called  a Financial Bill. It is a Bill which seeks to make \\nprovision for any of the  matters specified in sub-clauses(a) to \\n(f) of clause (1) of article 110 as also other matters. It is, so to \\nsay, a Bill which has characteristics both of a Money Bill… \\nfirstly, it cannot be introduced in Rajya Sabha, and secondly, \\nit cannot be introduced except on the recommendations of the \\n                                                 \\n48 Legislative Procedure in the Rajya Sabha,: Rajya Sabha Secretariat at p. 17 \\n59PART E \\nPresident. Except these two points of difference, a Financial \\nBill in all other respects is just like any other ordinary Bill. \\n(c). Financial Bills – Category-II \\nThere is yet another class of Bills which are also Financial \\nBills under article 117(3). Such Bills are more in the nature of \\nordinary Bills rather than the Money Bills and Financial Bills \\nmentioned earlier. The only point of difference between this \\ncategory of Financial Bills and the ordinary Bills is that such a \\nFinancial Bill, if enacted and brought into operation, involves \\nexpenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India and cannot \\nbe passed by either House of Parliament unless the President \\nhas recommended to that House the consideration of the Bill. \\nIn all other respects this category of Bills is, just like ordinary \\nBills, so that such a Financial Bill can be introduced in Rajya \\nSabha, amended by it or a joint sitting can be introduced in \\nRajya Sabha, amended by it or a joint sitting can be held in \\ncase of disagreement between the Houses over such a Bill. \\nThere is, in other words, no limitation on the power of Rajya \\nSabha in respect of such Financial Bills.‖         \\n \\nThe above classification re-emphasises the distinction of a Financial Bill with a Money \\nBill, which is a Bill which contains ‗only‘ provisions of the description specified in sub-\\nclauses (a) to (g) of Article 110(1).   \\n \\n65  The Rajya Sabha reflects the pluralism of the nation and ensures a balance of \\npower.  It  is  an  indispensable  constitutive  unit  of  the  federal  backbone  of  the \\nConstitution. Potential differences between the two houses of the Parliament cannot \\nbe resolved by simply ignoring the Rajya Sabha. In a federal polity such as ours, the \\nefficacy  of  a  constitutional  body  created  to  subserve  the  purpose  of  a  deliberate \\ndialogue, cannot be defeated by immunising from judicial review the decision of the \\nSpeaker to certify a Bill as a Money Bill. \\n \\n60PART F \\nF  Merits of the challenge \\nF.1  Passage as a Money Bill \\n66  On  19  February  2014,  the  Appellate  Tribunals  and  Other  Authorities \\n(Conditions  of  Service)  Bill  2014  was  introduced  in  the  Rajya  Sabha  to  provide \\n―uniform conditions of service of the Chairman and Members‖ of 26 tribunals. Clause \\n3 of the Bill provides: \\n―3. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the \\nprovisions of the specified Acts, the provisions of this Act \\nshall apply to the Chairman and Members appointed under \\nthe specified Acts: \\nProvided that the provisions of this Act shall not apply to the \\nChairman and other Members, as the case may be, holding \\nsuch  office  immediately  before  the  commencement  of  the \\nsaid Act.‖   \\n \\n‗Specified Acts‘ were enunciated in the First Schedule to the Bill. The Bill was referred \\nto the Department related Standing Committee which submitted its Seventy Fourth \\nReport  on  26  February  2015.  The  Bill  was  withdrawn  on  11  April  2017.\\n \\n \\n67  The Finance Bill 2017 was introduced as a Money Bill in the Lok Sabha with a \\nrecommendation of  the President  under clauses  (1)  and  (3) of  Article  117  of  the \\nConstitution. At the time of the introduction of the Bill on 1 February 2017, the Finance \\nBill 2017 comprised of 150 clauses together with seven schedules ―to give effect to \\nthe financial proposals of the Central Government for the financial year 2017-18‖. The \\nBill contained proposals inter alia to amend, add to and modify legislation dealing with \\ntaxation – direct, indirect and service taxes and other fiscal aspects. Part VIII of the\\nFinance  Bill  2017  sought  to  expand  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Securities  Appellate\\n61PART F \\nTribunal49 established under the SEBI Act 199250 and to make changes in the existing \\nprovisions  for  the  appointments  to  the  SAT.  The  Finance  Bill  was  taken  up  for \\ndiscussion on 21 March 2017 and was passed by the Lok Sabha on 22 March 2017 \\nwith 29 government amendments.  \\n \\n \\n68  On 21 March 2017, the Union Finance Minister proposed an amendment to \\nincorporate  Part  XI  (subsequently  renumbered  as  Part  XIV  in  the  Finance  Act) \\ncontaining 34 new clauses and two schedules to the Finance Bill.  Rule 80(i) of the \\nRules of Procedure for the Conduct of Business in the Lok Sabha stipulates that: \\n―80. Admissibility of amendments. \\nThe  following  conditions  shall  govern  the  admissibility  of \\namendments to clauses or schedules of a Bill: \\n(i)  An amendment shall be within the scope of the Bill \\nand relevant to the subject-matter of the clause to which it \\nrelates.‖   \\n \\nDuring the course of the discussion, the Speaker overruled the objection against the \\ninclusion of the proposed amendments dealing with non-fiscal subjects.  The Lok \\nSabha Debates elucidate: \\n―Hon. Members would recall that during last year when similar \\nobjections were raised at the time of consideration of the \\nFinance Bill, 2016, I had observed that as per rule 219, the \\nprimary object of a Finance Bill is to give effect to the financial \\nproposals of the Government. There is no doubt about it. At \\nthe same time, this Rule does not rule out the possibility of \\ninclusion  of  non-taxation  proposals.  Therefore,  I  have \\naccepted  this.  The  Finance  Bill  may  contain  non-taxation \\nproposals also… \\nSo, incidental provisions can be made. That is why, keeping \\nin view that rule 2019 does not specifically bar inclusion of \\nnon-taxation proposals in a Finance Bill, I rule out the Point of \\nOder.‖  \\n \\n                                                 \\n49 ―SAT‖ \\n50 ―SEBI Act 1992‖ \\n62PART F \\n \\n69  The Lok Sabha suspended  the operation  of  Rule  80(1) so  as  to  allow  the \\nproposed amendments to be incorporated in the Finance Bill. On 22 March 2017, the \\nHouse adopted the Finance Bill 2017 along with an amendment to insert Part XI \\n(renumbered as Part XIV in the Finance Act). The Bill was transmitted to the Rajya \\nSabha under Article 109(2) together with the certification of the Speaker.  The Rajya \\nSabha returned the Bill with its recommendations on 29 March 2017. On 30 March \\n2017, the Lok Sabha rejected the recommendations. Resultantly the Finance Bill was \\ndeemed to have been passed by both the Houses. \\n \\n \\n70  Upon the passage of the Finance Bill 2017, the Rules were notified by the \\nUnion of India in the Ministry of Finance on 1 June 2017. In terms of Section 184 of \\nthe  Finance  Act  2017,  the Rules  specify:  (i)  criteria  of  eligibility;  (ii)  procedure  of \\nselection; (iii) provisions for resignation and removal; (iv) salaries and emoluments; (v) \\nterm and tenure; and (vi) other service conditions such as leave and allowances to \\nmembers of scheduled tribunals.  \\n \\nPart XIV of the Finance Act 2017 is titled: ―Amendments to certain Acts to provide \\nfor  Merger  of  Tribunals  and  Other  Authorities  and  Conditions  of  Service  of \\nChairpersons, Members etc.‖ \\n \\n71  Section 158 effects amendments to several Parliamentary enactments: \\ni.

The  effect  of  Section  183  is  to \\noverride the provisions of those enactments and to stipulate that from the appointed \\nday, the provisions of Section 184 shall apply to Chairpersons, Vice Chairpersons, \\nPresidents, Vice Presidents, Presiding Officers and Members of the Tribunals or, as \\nthe case may be, Appellate Tribunals.  Those who hold office immediately before the \\nappointed day have been excluded.   \\nSection 184 stipulates: \\n―184. (1) The Central Government may, by notification, make \\nrules to provide for qualifications, appointment, term of office, \\nsalaries and allowances, resignation, removal and the other \\nterms  and  conditions  of  service  of  the Chairperson, Vice-\\nChairperson,  Chairman,  Vice-Chairman,  President,  Vice-\\nPresident,  Presiding  Officer  or  Member  of  the  Tribunal, \\nAppellate Tribunal or, as the case may be, other Authorities \\nas specified in column (2) of the Eighth Schedule:  \\nProvided that the Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson, Chairman, \\nVice-Chairman, President, Vice-President, Presiding Officer \\nor  Member  of  the  Tribunal,  Appellate  Tribunal  or  other \\nAuthority shall hold office for such term as specified in the \\nrules made by the Central Government but not exceeding five \\nyears from the date on which he enters upon his office and \\nshall be eligible for reappointment:  \\nProvided  further  that  no  Chairperson,  Vice-Chairperson, \\nChairman,  Vice-Chairman,  President,  Vice-President, \\nPresiding Officer or Member shall hold office as such after he \\nhas attained such age as specified in the rules made by the \\nCentral Government which shall not exceed,— \\n (a) in the case of Chairperson, Chairman or President, the \\nage of seventy years;  \\n65PART F \\n(b) in the case of Vice-Chairperson, Vice-Chairman, Vice-\\nPresident, Presiding Officer or any other Member, the age of \\nsixty-seven years: \\n (2) Neither the salary and allowances nor the other terms \\nand conditions of service of Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson, \\nChairman,  Vice-Chairman,  President,  Vice-President, \\nPresiding  Officer  or  Member  of  the  Tribunal,  Appellate \\nTribunal or, as the case may be, other Authority may be \\nvaried to his disadvantage after his appointment.‖ \\n \\n \\n73  Section 184 has conferred a rule making power on the Central Government to \\nprovide for the (i) qualifications; (ii) appointment; (iii) terms of office; (iv) salaries and \\nallowances;  (iv)  resignation;  (vi)  removal;  and  (viii)  other  terms  and  conditions  of \\nservice. The proviso stipulates that the term of office shall be such as is prescribed in \\nthe Rules  made  by the Central  Government  not  exceeding five  years and  that  a \\nMember would be eligible for reappointment. An upper age limit is prescribed by the \\nsecond  proviso.  Section  185  (1)  stipulates  that  Chairpersons,  Presidents  or  Vice \\nChairpersons, Vice Presidents, Presiding Officers and Members of the Tribunals or \\nAppellate Tribunals who hold office before the appointed day shall cease to do so and \\nbe entitled to compensation not exceeding three months‘ pay and allowances for the \\npremature termination of the term of office or the contract of service. \\n \\n \\n74  The learned Attorney General for India submitted that Part XIV of the Finance \\nAct 2017 is sustainable with reference to sub-clauses (c), (d) and (g) of clause (1) of \\nArticle 110. The submission is that the certification by the Speaker is of the entire \\nFinance Bill when it was transmitted to the Rajya Sabha. The Attorney General urged \\nthat payment of salaries is made out of the Consolidated Fund of India. Once this be \\nthe position, the other provisions of Part XIV are, it was urged, incidental in nature. It \\nis argued that salaries, allowances and pension will have a direct nexus with the \\n66PART F \\nConsolidated  Fund  of  India  and  are  incidental  to  the  provisions  contained  in  the \\nFinance Act 2017. In this context, reliance was placed on: (i) the presumption of \\nconstitutional validity (State of West Bengal v  Anwar Ali Sarkar51, R.K. Garg v \\nUnion  of  India52  and  Subramanian  Swamy  v  Director,  Central  Bureau  of \\nInvestigation53); (ii) the importance of the doctrine of separation of powers (Bhim \\nSingh v Union of India54).  \\n \\n \\n75  The provisions of Part XIV of the Finance Act 2017 amend, first and foremost, \\nthe legislative enactments under which diverse tribunals, including appellate tribunals \\nwere constituted. By and as a result of the amendments, the statutory provisions \\nrelating to qualifications for appointment, the process of appointment, terms of office \\nand the terms and conditions of service including salaries, allowances, resignation \\nand removal are overridden and are to be governed by the provisions of Section 184.  \\nSection 184 confers a rule making power on the Central Government to stipulate all \\nthe  above  aspects  in  regard  to  the  adjudicatory  personnel  appointed  to  these \\ntribunals. By this process, the governing statutory provisions embodied in the parent \\nlegislation are overridden and authority is conferred upon the Central Government to \\nformulate other aspects of the process from qualifications for office and the process of \\nappointment to the terms of service, through delegated legislation. \\n \\n \\n76  This, in our view, completely transgresses the conditions stipulated in Article \\n110(1) for constituting a Money Bill.  Article 110 does not bar the inclusion of non-\\nfiscal  proposals  in  a  Money  Bill.    But  while  permitting  the  inclusion  of  non-fiscal \\n                                                 \\n51 (1952) SCR 284 \\n52 (1981) 4 SCC 675 \\n53 (2014) 8 SCC 682 \\n54 (2010) 5 SCC 538 \\n67PART F \\nsubjects, sub-clause (g) of Article 110(1) embodies the requirement that such a matter \\nmust be incidental to any of the matters specified in sub-clauses (a) to (f).  In other \\nwords, the inclusion of a non-fiscal matter is permissible in a Money Bill only if it is \\nincidental or ancillary to a matter specified in sub-clauses (a) to (f). Part XIV has \\nrepealed and replaced substantive provisions contained in the enactments specified in \\nthe Eighth and Ninth Schedules which are not referable to sub-clauses (a) to (f) of \\nArticle 110(1). Part XIV of the Finance  Act  2017 is thus not incidental within the \\nmeaning of sub-clause (g).  The plain consequence is that by adopting the special \\nprocedure contained in Article 109, the substantive procedure governing Ordinary Bills \\nunder Articles 107 and 108 has been rendered otiose. If the provisions contained in \\nPart XIV were to be enacted in the form of an Ordinary Bill, the Rajya Sabha would \\nhave  a  vital  voice  in  deliberating  and  discussing  on  the  nature  of  the  legislative \\nproposals.  Part  XIV  contains  provisions  which  lie  outside  the  domain  permissible \\nunder Article 110. \\n \\n77  We are unimpressed with the submissions of the learned Attorney General that \\nsince salaries are payable out of the Consolidated Fund, Part XIV of the Finance Act \\nbears  a  nexus  with  sub-clauses  (c)  and  (d)  of  Article  110(1)  and  that  the  other \\nprovisions are merely incidental. That the amendment has a bearing on the financial \\nburden on the Consolidated Fund of India cannot be the sole basis of brining the \\namendment within the purview of Article 110(1). On a close analysis of the provisions, \\nit  is  evident  that  what  is  claimed  to  be  incidental  has  swallowed  up  the  entire \\nlegislative exercise. The provisions of Part XIV of the Finance Act 2017 canvass a \\nrange of amendments which include qualifications and process for appointment terms \\nof  office  and  terms  and  conditions  of  service  including  salaries,  allowances, \\n68PART F \\nresignation and removal which cannot be reduced to only a question of the financial \\nburden on the Consolidated Fund of India. The effect of Part XIV is to amend and \\nsupersede the provisions contained in the parent enactments governing all aspects of \\nthe appointment and terms of service of the adjudicatory personnel of the tribunals \\nspecified in the Eighth and Ninth Schedules. This exercise cannot be construed as a \\nlegitimate recourse to the power of enacting a Money Bill.  \\n \\n78  The Attorney General for India urged that the provisions of Part XIV of the \\nFinance Act 2017, in so far as they have a financial bearing on the Consolidated Fund \\nof India, are sustainable with reference to sub-clauses (c), (d), (e) and (g) of clause (1) \\nof Article 110.  \\n \\n79  Sub-clause (c) deals, inter alia, with the withdrawal of money from either the \\nConsolidated Fund of India or the Contingency Fund of India. Sub-clause (d) deals \\nwith the appropriation of money out of the Consolidated Fund of India. Sub-clause (e) \\nstipulates either the declaration of any expenditure or the increase in the amount of \\nexpenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund of India. It was contended that Part \\nXIV of the Finance Act 2017, in so far as it has a bearing on the Consolidated Fund of \\nIndia, is incidental to the matters referred in sub-clauses (c), (d) and (e) of Article \\n110(1). \\n \\n80  Sub-clause (g) stipulates that provisions dealing with any matter incidental to \\nthe matters specified in sub-clauses (a) to (f) fall within the purview of Article 110(1). \\nHowever, this is distinct from contending that where a bill contains provisions not \\nreferable to the sub-clauses (a) to (f) stipulated in clause (1) of Article 110 but has an \\n69PART F \\nincidental bearing on the Consolidated Fund of India, this by itself would bring such a \\nbill within the purview of sub-clause (g) of Article 110(1).  \\n \\n81  Article 110(1) defines a Money Bill as a bill which contains ―only provisions‖ \\ndealing with all or any of the matters enumerated in sub-clauses (a) to (f). The import \\nof sub-clause (g) of clause (1) of Article 110 is that the proposed bill may also contain \\nprovisions  which  have  an  incidental  bearing  on  the  matters  enumerated  in  sub-\\nclauses (a) to (f). However, sub-clause (g) cannot be read to permit a bill consisting of \\nprovisions which do not directly pertain to matters enumerated in sub-clauses (a) to \\n(f), but have only an incidental bearing on the matters enumerated in sub-clauses (a) \\nto (f). Implicit in the term ―incidental‖ is the relation between the principal subject \\nmatters of the bill which must be referable to sub-clauses (a) to (f) and other matters. \\nEvery provision of a bill which is claimed to be a Money Bill must directly pertain to \\nany  of  the  matters  enumerated  in  clauses  (a)  to  (f).  Where  it  is  claimed  that  a \\nprovision falls within the ambit of sub-clause (g), the provision must depend on or be \\nappurtenant ―to any of the matters specified in sub-clauses (a) to (f).‖ \\n \\n82  Part XIV of the Finance Act 2017 canvasses a range of amendments which \\ninclude qualifications and process for appointment of members of tribunals, terms of \\noffice and terms and conditions of service including salaries, allowances, resignation \\nand removal which are not referable to sub-clauses (a) to (f) of clause (1) of Article \\n110. Almost every government action involves an increase or decrease of expenditure \\nwhich may be relatable to the Consolidated Fund of India. Accepting the argument \\nurged would amount to inverting sub-clause (g) and allowing any bill which is not \\nreferable to the matters enumerated in Article 110(1) to be passed as a Money Bill so \\n70PART F \\nlong  as  it  can  be  shown  that  the  provisions  may  have  some  bearing  on  the \\nConsolidated Fund of India.  \\n \\n83  Further,  the  contention  urged  that  the  transfer  of  the  power  to  determine \\nsalaries has a direct nexus with the Consolidated Fund of India glosses over the \\ndistinction between the power to determine of modify salaries and the determination \\nor modification of the salary. The transfer of the power to determine or modify salaries \\ndoes not, by itself, lead to the conclusion that such transfer of authority to the rule \\nmaking function by the Central Government is referable to the Consolidated Fund of \\nIndia in the manner contemplated in the sub-clauses referred to above.  \\n \\n84  The  transfer  of  authority  to  determine  qualifications  and  process  for \\nappointments, terms of office and terms and conditions of service including salaries, \\nallowances, resignation and removal of tribunal members from the statutory provisions \\ndetermined by the legislature to the executive is the transfer of a substantive right \\nwhich  has  a  bearing  on  constitutional  design  as  well  as  the  independence  of \\nadjudicatory tribunals. They are not referable to sub-clauses (c), (d) and (e) of Article \\n110(1) and do not amount to matters incidental to any of the matters enumerated in \\nsub-clauses (a) to (f) of clause (1) of Article 110.  \\n \\n85  There  is  undoubtedly  a  presumption  of  constitutionality  which  attaches  to \\nlegislation.  The  presumption  is  founded  on  the  principle  that  the  legislature  in  a \\nparliamentary democracy understands the needs and conditions of the time and that \\nthe executive government which pilots legislation through the competent legislature is \\naccountable  to  both  the  legislature  and  to  the  people  whom  the  elected  arm  of \\ngovernment represents. But the presumption of constitutionality is what it is, namely, a \\n71PART F \\npresumption. The presumption can be displaced on a clear violation of a constitutional \\nmandate or infraction being established.  Where a Bill which contains provisions which \\nare not referable to sub-clauses (a) to (g) of clause (1) of Article 110 is passed as a \\nMoney  Bill,  that  constitutes  a  clear  violation  of  the  mandate  of  Article  110.  The \\npresumption of constitutionality stands displaced. \\n \\n86  The learned Attorney General urged that the doctrine of separation of powers \\nwould require this Court to tread with caution since certification of a Bill as a Money \\nBill, as he submits, pertains to the internal functioning of Parliament. Judicial review, it  \\nwas submitted, would violate the separation of powers.  The submission overlooks the \\nfundamental position that the certification of a Bill as a Money Bill and the invocation \\nof the provisions of Article 110 is an exception which has been carved out by the \\nConstitution to the constitutional requirements accompanying the passage of ordinary \\nlegislation.  In passing the Bill as a Money Bill, the immediate impact is to denude the \\nRajya Sabha of the legislative role which is assigned to it in the passage of legislation. \\n \\n87   The Rajya Sabha as a legislative institution represents the voice, concerns and \\naspirations of Indian federalism. The reduction of the role of the Rajya Sabha in the \\ncase of a Money Bill was engrafted by the draftspersons of the Constitution with a \\nspecific purpose. In their view, Money Bills should appropriately be reserved for the \\nauthority of the Lower House which consists of directly elected representatives of the \\npeople. But to regard a Bill which is not a Money Bill as one which passes muster \\nunder Article 110 is a breach of a substantive constitutional provision, a violation of \\nconstitutional process and hence, an illegality. \\n \\n \\n72PART F \\n88  The basic postulate of our Constitution is that every authority is subservient to \\nconstitutional supremacy. No authority  can assume to itself the ultimate power to \\ndecide the limits of its own constitutional mandate.  Judicial review is intended to \\nensure that every constitutional authority keeps within the bounds of its constitutional \\nfunctions and authority. In holding a constitutional institution within its bounds, judicial \\nreview does not trench upon the doctrine of separation of powers. The adjudicatory \\npower vests in the Supreme Court as a constitutional court. In adjudicating on whether \\nthere has been a violation of a constitutional mandate in passing a Bill as a Money \\nBill, judicial review does not traverse beyond the limit set by the separation of powers. \\nOn  the  contrary,  the  independence  of  judicial  tribunals  has  been  consistently \\nrecognised  by  this  Court  as  an  inviolable  feature  of  the  basic  structure  of  the \\nConstitution.  Determination  of  the  norms  of  eligibility,  the  process  of  selection,  \\nconditions of service,  and those regulating the impartiality with which the members of \\nthe tribunals discharge their functions and their effectiveness as adjudicatory bodies is \\ndependent on their isolation from the executive.  By leaving the rule making power to \\nthe  uncharted  wisdom  of  the  executive,  there  has  been  a  self-effacement  by \\nParliament. The conferment of the power to frame rules on the executive has a direct \\nimpact  on the independence  of  the tribunals.  Allowing  the executive  a  controlling \\nauthority  over  diverse  facets  of  the  tribunals  would  be  destructive  of  judicial \\nindependence which constitutes a basic feature of the Constitution. \\n \\nF.2  Violation of directions issued by this Court \\n \\n89  The Rules under Section 184 of the Finance Act 2017, termed the Tribunal, \\nAppellate  Tribunal  and  Other  Authorities  (Qualifications,  Experience  and  Other \\n73PART F \\nConditions of Service of Members) Rules 2017 were notified on 1 June 2017.  Rule 1 \\n(3) provides for the applicability of the rules in the following terms: \\n―(3) These rules shall apply to the Chairman, Vice-Chairman, \\nChairperson, Vice- Chairperson, President, Vice- President, \\nPresiding  Officer,  Accountant  Member,  Administrative \\nMember,  Judicial  Member,  Expert  Member,  Law  Member, \\nRevenue  Member,  Technical  Member,  Member  of  the \\nTribunal, Appellate Tribunal or, as the case may be, Authority \\nas  specified  in  column  (2)  of  the  Eighth  Schedule  of  the \\nFinance Act, 2017 (7 of 2017).‖ \\n \\n \\n90  Rule 3 prescribes the qualifications for appointment to those tribunals which are \\nspecified in Column 3 of the Schedule. Rule 4 provides that the method of recruitment \\nis specified in Column 4 of the Schedule. Rule 7 provides for the removal of a member \\nfrom  office  by  the  Central  Government  ―on  the  recommendation  of  a  committee \\nconstituted by it in this behalf‖.  Rule 8 provides for the procedure for enquiry into an \\nalleged  misbehaviour  or  incapacity  of  a  member.  It  contemplates  a  preliminary \\nscrutiny by the Ministry or the Department of the Government of India under which the \\ntribunal or appellate tribunal is constituted or established. Upon finding that there are \\nreasonable grounds in an inquiry, a reference is made to the committee constituted \\nunder Rule 7.  After the conclusion of the enquiry, the committee is to submit its report \\nto the Central Government with its findings.  Rule 9 provides for the term of office as \\nspecified in Column 5 of the Schedule with a cap on age as specified in Column 6. \\nRule 11 provides for a fixed salary of Rs 2.50 lakhs together with allowances and \\nbenefits admissible to a Central Government officer holding an office carrying the \\nsame pay in the case of the Chairperson or President or Presiding Officer of SAT. A \\nconsolidated salary of Rs 2.25 lakhs is payable to Vice Chairpersons, Vice Presidents \\nand Members.  \\n \\n74PART F \\nColumn 4 of the Schedule stipulates the composition of the Search-cum-Selection \\nCommittee  for  the  various  tribunals.  The  Search-cum-Selection  Committee  of  the \\nIndustrial Tribunal is as follows: \\n―Search-cum-Selection  Committee  for  the  post  of  the \\nPresiding  Officer,  -  (i)  a  person  to  be  nominated  by  the \\nCentral  Government  chairperson;  (ii)  Secretary  to  the \\nGovernment of India, Ministry of Labour and Employment- \\nmember;  (iii)  Secretary  to  the  Government  of  India  to  be \\nnominated  by  the  Central  Government-member;  (iv)  two \\nexperts  to  be  nominated  by  the  Central  Government- \\nmembers.‖ \\n \\n \\nIt  is evident  that  the Search-cum-Selection  Committee is constituted entirely from \\npersonnel  within  or  nominated  by  the  Central  Government.  Barring  the  National \\nCompany Law Appellate Tribunal, the Search-cum-Selection Committee for all other \\nseventeen  tribunals  specified  in  the  Schedule  is  constituted  either  entirely  from \\npersonnel within or nominated by the Central Government or comprises a majority of \\npersonnel from the Central Government. The Search-cum-Selection Committee of the \\nNational Company Law Appellate Tribunal consists of an equal number of members \\nfrom the judiciary as well as from the Central Government with no casting vote to the \\nChief Justice of India or their nominee: \\n―(B)  Search-cum-Selection  Committee  for  the  post  of  the \\nJudicial  Member  and  Technical  Member  of  the  Appellate \\nTribunal,  -  (i)  Chief  Justice  of  India  or  his  nominee  -\\nchairperson; (ii) a senior Judge of the Supreme Court or a \\nChief Justice of a High Court-member; (iii) Secretary to the \\nGovernment of India, Ministry of Corporate Affairs- member; \\n(iv) Secretary to the Government of India, Ministry of Law and \\nJustice-member.‖ \\n \\nThe procedure for selection is fundamentally destructive of judicial independence. The \\nUnion  Government  has  vital  status  in  the  disputes  before  many  tribunals.  Even \\n75PART F \\notherwise,  conferring  upon  the  government  such  a  dominating  and  overwhelming \\nvoice in making appointments is a negation of judicial independence.  \\n   \\n91  Sub-rule 2 of Rule 4 of the 2017 Rules stipulates that the Secretary to the \\nGovernment  of  India  in  the  Ministry  or  Department  shall  be  the  Convener  of  the \\nSearch-cum-Selection  Committee.  In  R  Gandhi,  the  Court  specifically  issued  the \\nfollowing directions in regard to the constitution of the Selection Committees: \\n―(viii) Instead of a five-member Selection Committee with the \\nChief Justice of India (or his nominee) as Chairperson and \\ntwo Secretaries from the Ministry of Finance and Company \\nAffairs and the Secretary in the Ministry of Labour and the \\nSecretary in the Ministry of Law and Justice as members \\nmentioned in Section 10-FX, the Selection Committee should \\nbroadly be on the following lines: \\n(a) Chief Justice of India or his nominee—Chairperson \\n(with a casting vote); \\n(b) A Senior Judge of the Supreme Court or Chief Justice \\nof High Court—Member; \\n(c) Secretary in the Ministry of Finance and Company \\nAffairs—Member; and \\n(d)  Secretary  in  the  Ministry  of  Law  and  Justice—\\nMember.‖ \\n(Emphasis supplied) \\n \\nSignificantly, Section 10 (FX) which was inserted into the Companies Act 1956 by the \\nCompanies (Second Amendment) Act 2002 relating to the Constitution of NCLT and \\nNCLAT contained the following provision: \\n―10-FX. Selection Committee.—(1) The Chairperson and Members of the Appellate \\nTribunal and President and Members of the Tribunal shall be appointed by the Central \\nGovernment on the recommendations of a Selection Committee consisting of— \\n(a)  Chief Justice of India or his nominee   \\nChairperson; \\n(b)  Secretary in the Ministry of Finance and  Member; \\nCompany Affairs \\n(c)  Secretary in the Ministry of Labour  Member; \\n(d)  Secretary in the Ministry of Law and Justice  Member; \\n(Department of Legal Affairs or Legislative \\nDepartment) \\n(e)  Secretary  in  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and          \\n76PART F \\nCompany  Affairs  (Department  of  Company  Member                  \\nAffairs)‖ \\n     \\n \\n92  In Madras Bar Association, Section 7 of the National Tax Tribunal Act 2005 \\nprovided  for  the  process  of  selection  and  appointment  of  the  Chairperson  and \\nmembers of the NTT. The Court observed that as the jurisdiction of the High Courts \\nwas  being  transferred  to  the  Tribunal,  the  stature  of  the  members,  conditions  of \\nservice, and manner of appointment and removal of members must be akin to that of \\nthe judges of High Courts. Section 7 was held to be invalid (among other provisions). \\nThe leading judgment of the majority by Justice J S Khehar (as the learned Judge \\nthen was) held: \\n―131. Section 7 cannot even otherwise be considered to be \\nconstitutionally  valid,  since  it  includes  in  the  process  of \\nselection and appointment of the Chairperson and Members \\nof  NTT,  Secretaries  of  Departments  of  the  Central \\nGovernment.  In  this  behalf,  it  would  also  be  pertinent  to \\nmention that the interests of the Central Government would \\nbe represented on one side in every litigation before NTT. It is \\nnot possible to accept a party to a litigation can participate in \\nthe selection process whereby the Chairperson and Members \\nof the adjudicatory body are selected. This would also be \\nviolative of the recognised constitutional convention recorded \\nby Lord Diplock in Hinds case [Hinds v. R., 1977 AC 195 : \\n(1976) 2 WLR 366 : (1976) 1 All ER 353 (PC)] , namely, that it \\nwould make a mockery of the Constitution, if the legislature \\ncould  transfer  the  jurisdiction  previously  exercisable  by \\nholders of judicial offices to holders of a new court/tribunal (to \\nwhich some different name was attached) and to provide that \\npersons  holding  the  new  judicial  offices  should  not  be \\nappointed in the manner and on the terms prescribed for \\nappointment of members of the judicature. For all the reasons \\nrecorded hereinabove, we hereby declare Section 7 of the \\nNTT Act, as unconstitutional.‖ \\n \\n \\n93  The constitution of the Search-cum-Selection committees as stipulated in the \\nSchedule  to  the  2017  Rules  cannot  pass  constitutional  muster  under  a  system \\ngoverned by the rule of law that accords primacy to the independence of the judiciary. \\n77PART F \\nIndependence  of  the  judiciary  requires  that  judicial  functioning  be  free  from \\ninterference by the other two organs of the state. The Central Government is the \\nlargest  litigant  before  the  tribunals  constituted  under  various  statutes.  The \\nindependent functioning of the tribunals stands compromised where the executive has \\nthe controlling authority in the selection of members to the tribunals. The executive is \\noften a litigant before and has an interest in the disputes which are adjudicated by the \\ntribunals. The constitution of the Search-cum-Selection committees stipulated in the \\n2017 Rules violates the principle of judicial independence and the directions issued by \\nthis Court in R Gandhi and Madras Bar Association. \\n \\n94  Column 5 of the Schedule to the 2017 Rules stipulates that the term of office \\nshall be three years for all tribunals. This disregards the principle enunciated by this \\nCourt in R Gandhi. By the judgment of this Court, the following direction was issued: \\n―(ix) The term of office of three years shall be changed to a \\nterm  of  seven  or  five  years  subject  to  eligibility  for \\nappointment for one more term. This is because considerable \\ntime is required to achieve expertise in the field concerned. A \\nterm of three years is very short and by the time the members \\nachieve the required knowledge, expertise and efficiency, one \\nterm will be over. Further the said term of three years with the \\nretirement age of 65 years is perceived as having been tailor-\\nmade for persons who have retired or shortly to retire and \\nencourages these Tribunals to be treated as post-retirement \\nhavens.  If  these  Tribunals  are  to  function  effectively  and \\nefficiently they should be able to attract younger members \\nwho will have a reasonable period of service.‖ \\n \\n \\nRule 18(2) stipulates that members who have been appointed to tribunals shall not \\npractice before the tribunal, appellate tribunal or the authority after retirement. We are \\nin agreement with the views expressed by this Court in R Gandhi. Inherent in the \\nefficient functioning of tribunals is that appointment to tribunals is made attractive to \\npracticing individuals who are guaranteed a reasonable period of service. \\n78PART F \\n \\n \\n95  Section 184 stipulates that the Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson, Chairman, Vice-\\nChairman, President, Vice-President, Presiding Officer or Member of the Tribunal, \\nAppellate Tribunal or other Authority is eligible for reappointment. This is restated in \\nRule  9.  This  is  in  violation  of  the  direction  issued  by  this  Court  in  Madras  Bar \\nAssociation where Section 8 which provided for reappointment was struck down in \\nthe following terms: \\n―132. Insofar as the validity of Section 8 of the NTT Act is \\nconcerned, it clearly emerges from a perusal thereof that a \\nChairperson/Member  is  appointed  to  NTT,  in  the  first \\ninstance, for a duration of 5 years. Such Chairperson/Member \\nis eligible for reappointment for a further period of 5 years. \\nWe  have  no  hesitation  to  accept  the  submissions \\nadvanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the \\npetitioners,  that  a  provision  for  reappointment  would \\nitself have the effect of undermining the independence of \\nthe  Chairperson/Members  of  NTT.  Every \\nChairperson/Member  appointed  to  NTT  would  be \\nconstrained to decide matters in a manner that would \\nensure his reappointment in terms of Section 8 of the \\nNTT Act. His decisions may or may not be based on his \\nindependent  understanding.  We  are  satisfied  that  the \\nabove provision would undermine the independence and \\nfairness of the Chairperson and Members of NTT. Since \\nNTT has been vested with jurisdiction which earlier lay with \\nthe High Courts, in all matters of appointment, and extension \\nof tenure, must be shielded from executive involvement. The \\nreasons for our instant conclusions are exactly the same as \\nhave been expressed by us while dealing with Section 5 of \\nthe NTT Act. We therefore hold that Section 8 of the NTT Act \\nis unconstitutional.‖ \\n(Emphasis supplied) \\n \\nRule 20 vests the Central Government with vast powers to relax the provisions of the \\napplicable rules: \\n \\n―Where the Central Government is of the opinion that it is \\nnecessary or expedient so to do, it may, by order for reasons \\nto be recorded in writing relax any of the provisions of these \\nrules with respect to any class or category of persons.‖ \\n79PART F \\n \\n96  The Central Government to whom a rule making authority was conferred by \\nSection 184 has not observed the principles which were enunciated in R Gandhi and \\nMadras  Bar  Association  either  in  letter  or  in  spirit.  The  dangers  inherent  in \\nconferring such an unguided power on the executive to frame rules governing the \\nselection, appointment and conditions of service of the members of the tribunals is \\nevident from the rules which have been framed. The rules disregard binding principles \\nenunciated  in  decisions  of  this  court.  The  rules  are  destructive  of  judicial \\nindependence and are unconstitutional. \\n \\n97  Before  concluding,  it  is  necessary  to  advert  to  two  pre-eminent  authorities \\nwhich were adverted to in the decisions in R Gandhi and in the concurring judgment \\nin Madras Bar Association.  In R Gandhi, Justice RV Raveendran observed: \\n \\n―112. What is a matter of concern is the gradual erosion of the \\nindependence of the judiciary, and shrinking of the space \\noccupied by the judiciary and gradual increase in the number \\nof persons belonging to the civil service discharging functions \\nand exercising jurisdiction which was previously exercised by \\nthe  High  Court.  There  is  also  a  gradual  dilution  of  the \\nstandards and qualification prescribed for persons to decide \\ncases which were earlier being decided by the High Courts.‖ \\n \\n \\nThe learned Judge referred to the cautionary words of Justice William O Douglas, a \\ndistinguished judge of the US Supreme Court: \\n―52.The  need  for  vigilance  in  jealously  guarding  the \\nindependence of courts and Tribunals against dilution and \\nencroachment, finds an echo in an advice given by Justice \\nWilliam O. Douglas to young lawyers (The Douglas Letters: \\nSelections from the Private Papers of William Douglas, edited \\nby Melvin L. Urofsky, 1987 Edn., p. 162, Adler and Adler): \\n―… The Constitution and the Bill of Rights were designed to \\nget  Government  off  the  backs  of  people—all  the  people. \\nThose great documents did not give us the welfare State. \\n80PART F \\nInstead, they guarantee to us all the rights to personal and \\nspiritual self-fulfilment. \\nBut that guarantee is not self-executing. As nightfall does not \\ncome all at once, neither does oppression. In both instances, \\nthere  is  a  twilight  when  everything  remains  seemingly \\nunchanged. And it is in such twilight that we all must be most \\naware of change in the air—however slight—lest we become \\nunwitting victims of the darkness.‖ \\n \\nIn  Madras  Bar  Association,  Justice  Rohinton  Nariman,  in  the  course  of  his \\nconcurring judgment, adverted to a decision of Lord Atkin: \\n \\n―178. In Proprietary Articles Trades Assn. v. Attorney General \\nfor Canada [1931 AC 310 (PC)] , Lord Atkin said: (AC p. 317) \\n―… Their Lordships entertain no doubt that time alone will not \\nvalidate an Act which when challenged is found to be ultra \\nvires; nor will a history of a gradual series of advances till this \\nboundary  is  finally  crossed  avail  to  protect  the  ultimate \\nencroachment.‖ \\n \\n98  We find that though the decision in R Gandhi was delivered in 2010 and in \\nMadras Bar Association in 2014, the same anomalies have persisted.  An attempt \\nhas been made to dilute judicial independence by a creeping assertion of executive \\npower. This is unconstitutional. \\n \\nF.3  Severability  \\n \\n99  The learned Attorney General submitted that the certification of the Speaker of \\nthe Bill as a Money Bill attaches to the entirety of the Finance Bill.  Hence, it was \\nurged, that the consequence of accepting the submission of the petitioners would \\nresult in the invalidation of the entire Finance Act.  We are of the view that this Court \\nshould  apply  the  doctrine  of  severability  to  Part  XIV  of  the  Finance  Act  2017. \\nSeverability was applied in a judgment of this Court in R.M.D. Chamarbaugwalla v \\n81PART F \\nUnion of India (―Chamarbaugwalla‖)55.  Justice Venkatarama Ayyar, speaking for a \\nConstitution Bench of this Court observed: \\n \\n―12. The question whether a statute which is void in part is to \\nbe  treated  as  void in  toto,  or  whether  it  is  capable  of \\nenforcement as to that part which is valid, is one which can \\narise only with reference to laws enacted by bodies which do \\nnot possess unlimited powers of legislation, as, for example, \\nthe legislatures in a Federal Union. The limitation on their \\npowers may be of two kinds: It may be with reference to the \\nsubject-matter on which they could legislate, as, for example, \\nthe topics enumerated in the Lists in the Seventh Schedule in \\nthe Indian Constitution, Sections 91 and 92 of the Canadian \\nConstitution, and Section 51 of the Australian Constitution; or \\nit may be with reference to the character of the legislation \\nwhich they could enact in respect of subjects assigned to \\nthem, as for example, in relation to the fundamental rights \\nguaranteed  in  Part  III  of  the  Constitution  and  similar \\nconstitutionally protected rights in the American and other \\nConstitutions. When a legislature whose authority is subject \\nto limitations aforesaid enacts a law which is wholly in excess \\nof  its  powers,  it  is  entirely  void  and  must  be  completely \\nignored. But where the legislation falls in part within the area \\nallotted to it and in part outside it, it is undoubtedly void as to \\nthe latter; but does it on that account become necessarily void \\nin its entirety? The answer to this question must depend on \\nwhether what is valid could be separated from what is invalid, \\nand that is a question which has to be decided by the court on \\na consideration of the provisions of the Act. ― \\n \\n \\nAdverting to the decision in State of Bombay v F N Balsara56, the Constitution Bench \\nobserved: \\n―This  decision  is  clear  authority  that  the  principle  of \\nseverability is applicable even when the partial invalidity of \\nthe Act arises by reason of its contravention of constitutional \\nlimitations.‖   \\n \\n \\n100  In State of Bombay v United Motors (India) Ltd.57, Chief Justice Patanjali \\nSastri held that the doctrine of severability should be extended in dealing with taxing \\n                                                 \\n55 1957 SCR 930 \\n56 1951 SCR 682 \\n57 1953 SCR 1069 \\n82PART F \\nstatutes.  After  adverting  to  these  decisions  in  Chamarbaugwalla,  Justice \\nVenkatarama Ayyar concluded: \\n―21…The  resulting  position  may  thus  be  stated:  When  a \\nstatute is in part void, it will be enforced as regards the rest, if \\nthat is severable from what is invalid. It is immaterial for the \\npurpose of this rule whether the invalidity of the statute arises \\nby reason of its subject-matter being outside the competence \\nof the legislature or by reason of its provisions contravening \\nconstitutional prohibitions.‖ \\n \\nThe principles which govern the exercise of the doctrine of severability have been \\nformulated thus: \\n―22… \\n1. In determining whether the valid parts of a statute are \\nseparable from the invalid parts thereof, it is the intention of \\nthe legislature that is the determining factor. The test to be \\napplied is whether the legislature would have enacted the \\nvalid part if it had known that the rest of the statute was \\ninvalid.  Vide Corpus  Juris  Secundum,  Vol.  82,  p. \\n156; Sutherland on Statutory Construction, Vol. 2 pp. 176-\\n177. \\n2. If the valid and invalid provisions are so inextricably mixed \\nup that they cannot be separated from one another, then the \\ninvalidity of a portion must result in the invalidity of the Act in \\nits entirety. On the other hand, if they are so distinct and \\nseparate that after striking out what is invalid, what remains is \\nin itself a complete code independent of the rest, then it will \\nbe  upheld  notwithstanding  that  the  rest  has  become \\nunenforceable. Vide Cooley\\'s Constitutional Limitations, Vol. I \\nat pp. 360-361; Crawford on Statutory Construction, pp. 217-\\n218. \\n3. Even when the provisions which are valid are distinct and \\nseparate from those which are invalid, if they all form part of a \\nsingle scheme which is intended to be operative as a whole, \\nthen also the invalidity of a part will result in the failure of the \\nwhole. Vide Crawford on Statutory Construction, pp. 218-219. \\n4. Likewise, when the valid and invalid parts of a statute are \\nindependent and do not form part of a scheme but what is left \\nafter omitting the invalid portion is so thin and truncated as to \\nbe in substance different from what it was when it emerged \\nout  of  the  legislature,  then  also  it  will  be  rejected  in  its \\nentirety. \\n83PART F \\n5. The separability of the valid and invalid provisions of a \\nstatute does not depend on whether the law is enacted in the \\nsame  section  or  different  sections;  (Vide Cooley\\'s \\nConstitutional Limitations, Vol. I, pp. 361-362); it is not the \\nform, but the substance of the matter that is material, and that \\nhas to be ascertained on an examination of the Act as a \\nwhole and of the setting of the relevant provision therein. \\n6. If after the invalid portion is expunged from the statute what \\nremains cannot be enforced without making alterations and \\nmodifications therein, then the whole of it must be struck \\ndown  as  void,  as  otherwise  it  will  amount  to  judicial \\nlegislation. Vide Sutherland on Statutory Construction, Vol. 2, \\np. 194. \\n7.  In  determining  the  legislative  intent  on  the  question  of \\nseparability,  it  will  be  legitimate  to  take  into  account  the \\nhistory of the legislation, its object, the title and the preamble \\nto it. Vide Sutherland on Statutory Construction, Vol. 2, pp. \\n177-178.‖ \\n \\n101  In the present case, applying these principles enunciated above, Part XIV of the \\nFinance Act 2017 is severable. The intent of the legislature is the guiding principle \\nunder the first of the above principles. Parliament would, in any event, have enacted \\nthe valid parts of the Finance Act 2017 if it had known that Part XIV is invalid. The \\nvalid and invalid parts are not so inextricably linked that the invalidity of Part XIV \\nshould result in the invalidity of the rest. Nor is Part XIV a part of a composite scheme \\nlinked to the other parts of the Finance Act 2017. Even after the excision of Part XIV \\nthe remaining part of the Finance Act would still survive on its own.  Hence, Part XIV \\nof the Finance Act 2017 can be excised from the Act.  \\n \\n \\n102  Finally, a fervent plea was made by the learned Attorney General to the effect \\nthat even though some provisions contained in the Rules framed on 1 June 2017 may \\nrun contrary to the principles enunciated by this Court in R Gandhi and Madras Bar \\nAssociation, the Central Government would be willing to proceed on the basis of the \\ninterim  orders  which  were  passed  by  this  Court  during  the  pendency  of  the \\n84PART F \\nproceedings with certain modifications. We are unable to accept the submission. Part \\nXIV of the Finance Act 2017 could not have been enacted in the form of a Money Bill. \\nThe rules framed by the Central Government are unconstitutional on the ground that \\nthey violate the principles of judicial independence set out in judgments of this Court.\\n      \\nG  Conclusion \\n \\n103  Part XIV of the Finance Act 2017 could not have been enacted in the form of a \\nMoney Bill. The rules which have been framed pursuant of the rule making power \\nunder  Section  184  are  held  to  be  unconstitutional.  However,  since  during  the \\npendency of these proceedings, certain steps were taken in pursuance of the interim \\norders and appointments have been made, we direct that those appointments shall \\nnot be  affected by the declaration  of  unconstitutionality.  The terms and  conditions \\ngoverning the personnel so appointed shall however abide by the parent enactments.  \\nUpon  the  declaration  of  unconstitutionality,  the  conditions  specified  in  all \\ncorresponding aspects in the parent enactments shall continue to operate.  \\n \\n \\n104  This Court has repeatedly emphasised the need for setting up an independent \\nstatutory body to oversee the working of tribunals. Despite the directions issued by \\nthis Court in Chandra Kumar nearly two decades ago, no action has been taken by \\nthe legislature to put in place an umbrella organisation which would be tasked with \\naddressing the drawbacks of the system to which we have adverted above. The lack \\nof a single authority to ensure competence and uniform service conditions has led to a \\nfragmented  tribunal  system  that  defeats  the  purpose  for  which  the  system  was \\nconstituted.  Moreover,  the  co-ordinating  authority  for  all  tribunals  must  be  the \\n85PART G \\nDepartment  of  Justice.  Vesting  that  function  in  individual  ministries  has  led  to \\nhaphazard evolution of the tribunal structure, besides posing serious dangers to the \\nindependence of tribunals.  \\n \\n \\n105  It  is  imperative  that  an  overarching  statutory  organisation  be  constituted \\nthrough legislative intervention to oversee the working of tribunals. We recommend \\nthe  constitution  of  an  independent  statutory  body  called  the  ―National  Tribunals \\nCommission‖58 to oversee the selection process of members, criteria for appointment, \\nsalaries  and  allowances,  introduction  of  common  eligibility  criteria,  for  removal  of \\nChairpersons and Members as also for meeting the requirement of infrastructural and \\nfinancial  resources.  The  legislation  should  aim  at  prescribing  uniform  service \\nconditions for members. The Commission should comprise the following members: \\n(i)  Three serving judges of the Supreme Court of India nominated by the Chief \\nJustice of India; \\n(ii)  Two serving Chief Justices or judges of the High Court nominated by the Chief \\nJustice of India;  \\n(iii)  Two members to be nominated by the Central Government  from amongst \\nofficers holding at least the rank to a Secretary to the Union Government: one \\nof them shall be the Secretary to the Department of Justice who will be the ex-\\nofficio convener; and \\n(iv)  Two independent expert members to be nominated by the Union government in \\nconsultation with the Chief Justice of India.  \\n \\n                                                 \\n58 ―NTC‖ \\n86PART G \\n106  The senior-most among the Judges nominated by the Chief Justice of India \\nshall be designated as the Chairperson of the NTC. \\n \\n107  While the setting up of the NTC is within the competence of the legislature, it \\nmust be ensured that the guidelines that have been laid down by this Court to ensure \\nthe  independence  and  efficient  functioning  of  the  tribunal  system  in  India  are \\nobserved. The independence of judicial tribunals is an inviolable feature of the basic \\nstructure of the Constitution. The procedure of selection, appointment, removal of \\nmembers and prescription of the service conditions of tribunal members determine the \\nindependence of the tribunals. As we have held, in preserving the independence of \\nthe  tribunals  as  a  facet  of  judicial  independence,  the  adjudicatory  body  must  be \\nrobust: subservient to  none and accountable  to  the need to render justice  in the \\ncontext  of  specialized  adjudication.  This  is  reflected  in  the  need  for  vigilance  in \\nguarding the independence of courts and tribunals. \\n \\n108  Competence, professionalism and specialisation are indispensable facets of a \\nrobust tribunal system designed to deliver specialised justice. The Commission must \\nbe vested with the power to oversee the administration of all tribunals established \\nunder the enactments of Parliament to ensure the adequate manning of the tribunals \\nwith the infrastructure and staff required to meet the exigencies of the system. The \\nUnion government should also consider formulating a law to ensure the constitution of \\nan All India Tribunal Service governing the recruitment and conditions of service of the \\nnon-adjudicatory personnel for tribunals. At present, the administrative staff of the \\ntribunals is by and large brought on deputation. The tribunals are woefully short of an \\nadequate complement of trained administrative personnel. Hence, there is an urgent \\n87PART G \\nneed to set up an All India Tribunal Service in the interests of the effective functioning \\nof the tribunal system.    \\n \\nThough the present judgment analyses the ambit of the word ―only‖ in Article 110(1) \\nand  the  interpretation  of  sub-clauses  (a)  to  (g)  of  clause  (1)  of  Article  110  and \\nconcludes that Part XIV of the Finance Act 2017 could not have been validly enacted \\nas a Money Bill, I am in agreement with the reasons which have been set out by the \\nlearned Chief Justice of India to refer the aspect of money bill to a larger Bench and \\ndirect accordingly. \\n \\nI am in agreement with the observations of brother Justice Deepak Gupta that the \\nqualifications of members to tribunals constitute an essential legislative function and \\ncannot be delegated.  Tribunals have been conceptualized as specialized bodies with \\ndomain-specific knowledge expertise.  Indispensable to this specialized adjudicatory \\nfunction is the selection of members trained in their discipline.  Keeping this in mind, \\nthe prescription of qualifications for members of tribunals is a legislative function in its \\nmost essential character. \\n \\nThe qualifications for appointment to adjudicatory bodies determine the character of \\nthe body.  The adjudicatory tribunals are intended to fulfil the objects of legislation \\nenacted  by  Parliament,  be  it  in  the  area  of  consumer  protection,  environmental \\nadjudication,  industrial  disputes  and  in  diverse  aspects  of  economic  regulation. \\nDefining  the  qualifications  necessary  for  appointment  of  members  constitutes  the \\ncore, the very essence of the tribunal. This is an essential legislative function and \\ncannot be delegated to the rule making authority of the central government.  It is for \\n88PART G \\nthe legislature to define the conditions which must be fulfilled for appointment after \\nassessing the need for domain specific knowledge.   \\n \\n \\n \\n.……......................................................J \\n                        [Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud] \\n \\n \\nNew Delhi; \\nNovember 13, 2019. \\n89REPORTABLE \\n \\nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA  \\nCIVIL APPELLATE/ORIGINAL JURISDICTION \\n \\nCIVIL APPEAL NO.8588 OF 2019 \\n(@ Special Leave Petition (Civil) No.15804 of 2017) \\n \\nROJER MATHEW                         …APPELLANT(S) \\n \\nVersus \\n \\nSOUTH INDIAN BANK LTD. & ORS.          …RESPONDENT(S) \\n \\n \\nWITH \\n \\nW.P.(C)  No.267/2012,  W.P.(C)  No.  279/2017,  W.P.(C)  No. \\n558/2017,  W.P.(C)  No.  561/2017,  W.P.(C)  No.  625/2017,  \\nW.P.(C)  No.  640/2017,  W.P.(C)  No.  1016/2017,  W.P.(C)  No. \\n788/2017,  W.P.(C)  No.  925/2017,  W.P.(C)  No.  1098/2017, \\nW.P.(C)  No.  1129/2017,  W.P.(C)  No.  33/2018,  W.P.(C)  No. \\n205/2018, W.P.(C) No. 467/2018, T.C.(C) No. 49/2018, T.C.(C) \\nNo. 51/2018, T.P.(C) No. 2199/2018  \\n \\n \\nJ U D G M E N T'"
